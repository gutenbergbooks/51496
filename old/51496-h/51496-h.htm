PREFATORY NOTE
</p>

<p>
No apology seems necessary for illustrating such
an essay as the present, save that it is an
innovation.  No one now denies the value of portraits
in rendering history more vivid; and it might be
argued that an essay dealing with a personality
requires illustration more, not less, than important
historical studies.
</p>

<p>
My best thanks are due to the Keeper of the
Hope Collection of Engraved Portraits, Oxford, and
his assistants, for the use of eight of the illustrations,
and for their unfailing courtesy and ready assistance
in the selection; to the well-known publishers,
Messrs. Velhagen &amp; Klasing, of Leipzig, for the use of
illustrations 6, 7 and 12; and to Herr Löwy, of Vienna,
for the two photographs of Maximilian (frontispiece)
and Bianca Maria Sforza.
</p>

<p>
The Imperial Arms of Maximilian, which appear
upon the cover, are taken from Sir David Lindsay's
Scottish Heraldic Manuscript.
</p>

<p>
But for a prolonged illness the essay would have
undergone a much more thorough revision.

<h3>
I
</h3>

<p>
There is a peculiar difficulty in bridging over long
periods of history, and in clearing our minds of
the habits and prejudices of to-day, before we criticize
characters and events which belong to distant periods
and other lands.  This difficulty, in spite of the strange
charm which encourages us to surmount it, makes
itself all the more felt in a Transition Period, such as
the close of the fifteenth, and the dawn of the
sixteenth century.  The breath of new ideas is in the air.
</p>

<p>
"The old order changeth, yielding place to new,"
but the old dreams are not yet banished from the
imagination, and the old ideals have not yet wholly
lost their power.  Change is everywhere apparent,
consummation is still a dream of the far-distant
future.  To those who look for a figure typical of the
age, Maximilian stands forth pre-eminent.  Heir to all
the splendid traditions of the Caesars and the later
glories of the Saxon and Franconian Emperors, he
filled the highest position of Germany, not in an
attitude of indifference or aloofness, but devoting all his
energies and sympathies to every movement or aspiration
of his time.  His actual achievements in the hard
concrete of facts are, from a national point of view,
but small; but these are more than balanced by his
activity in other and more abstract directions.  It is
in his relations to the budding thought of modern life
that we can feel the real charm and fascination of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P2"></a>2}</span>
Maximilian's character.  For his was a nature which
could never rest satisfied with the past, and aspired
to ends which only the far distant future was destined
to attain.
</p>

<p>
Maximilian cannot fairly be judged solely from an
historical standpoint; from this a judgment in the
main unfavourable would be difficult to avoid.  For
his task was to bridge over a necessary period of
transition&mdash;to check the perils of innovation, to
employ political expedients which could not, from their
very nature, stand the shock of later developments,
and to make shift with materials and resources which
were soon to be altered or replaced.  Hence his
achievements, though of very real value to his own
age, have left but few traces visible to modern eyes.
The Southern temperament which he inherited from
his mother often drove him into foolhardy adventures,
from which he only extricated himself with a loss of
dignity.  But the questionable results of his headlong
enthusiasms are atoned for by the noble ideals which
prompted them; and the very traits which were
disastrous to his political career have earned for him his
truest claims to greatness.
</p>

<p>
To tell the life-story of an idealist seems to be
repugnant to the most modern of historical methods.
Hard dry facts must be summoned to describe
his career; an array of political exploits and the
wearisome details of fruitless legal reforms must be
poured forth in profitless and unending monotony.
The soul and its impulses, human or divine, seem no
longer to be admitted to the chamber of the historian,
whose dull and regulated pulse scorns to beat faster
at the tragedy of human lives.  But if there is one
case in which a true account must not be limited to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P3"></a>3}</span>
mere facts, it is that of Maximilian.  The specious
system of accumulating details, coldly balancing them,
and leaving the reader to judge, would be utterly unfair
in his case.  As well attempt to do justice to Luther,
while omitting the agonies and self-reproach of his
cloister life, the deep formative influence of those
silent months upon the Wartburg, as estimate Maximilian,
the dreamer and idealist, by the necessities of
his purse or the extravagance of his vast designs!
His personality and his office do not by any means
coincide.  There are many features of his character
which have no connexion with the government of his
lands, which the historians of his own day overlooked,
and which would still be overlooked from a strictly
political and historical point of view.  But while our
admiration is aroused by his active share in the great
living movements of the age, it must be confessed that
his versatility and breadth of interest have an
unfortunate counterpart in the fickleness and lack of
concentration which led him to flit from scheme to
scheme, without ever allowing any single one to
attain to maturity.  Such inconstancy in a sovereign
is usually negatived, or at least held in bounds, by the
apparatus of government.  But in this case all
centred in Maximilian himself, and not even the
influential Matthew Lang was entirely trusted in high
affairs of state.  As a rule, Maximilian could not
endure to have men of masterly or original character
about him, mainly owing to the passionate conviction
with which he clung to his own opinions, and partly
perhaps to a half-conscious fear of unfavourable
comparisons.  We are thus driven to the conclusion that
his policy is mainly his own work, and that, though
inspired by lofty patriotism and definite family and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P4"></a>4}</span>
territorial ambitions, he never succeeded in combining
the two motives, and finally left the problem unsolved
and insoluble.  But this conviction should only serve
to remind us that his greatest achievements lie
outside the province of politics.  Indeed, regarded as a
whole, his life is not so much a great historical drama,
as an epic poem of chivalry, rich in bright colours and
romantic episodes, and crowded with the swift turns
and surprises of fortune.

<h3>
II
</h3>

<p>
To describe the events of Maximilian's political
career with any sort of detail would be to
narrate the history of Europe during one of its most
fascinating and complicated phases.  To an essay
such as the present such a scheme must be
entirely alien; and for its purposes Maximilian's life
may be broadly divided into two periods.  In the first,
which ends with 1490, his ambitions are directed
towards the West; and Burgundy, the Netherlands,
and the French frontier claim his whole attention.
But in the midst of his designs against France, new
developments at home summon him away.  The
acquisition of Tyrol and the recovery of Austria shift
the centre of gravity from West to East, and his
accession to the Empire finally compels him to take up
new threads of policy, which point him to the East
and the South rather than to the West.  In this later
period, which is more purely political, and in which
the character of Maximilian is perhaps less marked,
the main trend of his policy is towards the
re-establishment of Imperial influence in Italy, and
combinations either against the French or the Turks.  In
each case he is doomed to disappointment; and the
misfortunes that arise from his continual lack of money
and resources form a story at once irritating and
pathetic.
</p>

<p>
While engaged in certain operations against the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P6"></a>6}</span>
County of Cilly, 1452, the Emperor Frederick
III. narrowly escaped capture by the enemy.  He ascribed
his safety to a dream, in which St. Maximilian[<a id="chap02fn1text"></a><a href="#chap02fn1">1</a>] warned
him of his danger; and thus when his wife presented
him with a son, the infant received the name of
his father's saintly patron.  Maximilian was born
at Neustadt near Vienna on May 22, 1459.  His
mother, Eleanor of Portugal, whose marriage to
Frederick III. has been immortalized by the brush of
Pinturicchio,[<a id="chap02fn2text"></a><a href="#chap02fn2">2</a>] was a princess of lively wit and
considerable talent: and many points of his character
are to be traced to the Southern temperament of
Eleanor, rather than to the phlegmatic and ineffectual
nature of Frederick.  His early years were times of
stress and trouble; and, while still an infant, he
shared the dangers of his parents, who were closely
besieged in the citadel of Vienna by Albert of Austria
and the insurgent citizens.  To such straits was the
slender garrison reduced, that the young prince is
said to have wandered through the castle vaults,
tearfully begging the servants for a piece of bread.[<a id="chap02fn3text"></a><a href="#chap02fn3">3</a>]
In spite of a vigorous defence, Frederick must have
yielded to superior force, but for the timely assistance
of his allies, the Bohemians, through whose influence
peace was restored between the rival brothers.  The
death of Albert in 1463 left Frederick supreme in
Austria and its dependencies.  But his past experiences
had inspired him with a very natural prejudice against
the citizens of Vienna; and they, on their part, were
never slow to reveal the dislike and contempt in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P7"></a>7}</span>
which they held their Imperial master.  This mutual
ill-feeling largely accounts for the ease with which
Matthias effected the conquest of Austria.  Frederick,
at first from choice, later from necessity, chose Linz
or Graz as his Austrian residences, and never
overcame his distrust of the Viennese.  Thus it was that
Maximilian's childhood was spent at Wiener Neustadt,
thirteen miles S.E. from Vienna.  His education was
entrusted to Peter Engelbrecht, afterwards Bishop of
Wiener Neustadt; and we learn that up to the age of
six he found great difficulty in articulating.  This may
have thrown him back somewhat; and, indeed, he
himself complained in later days of his bad education.
"If Peter, my teacher, still lived," he declared, "I
would make him live near me, in order to teach him
how to bring up children."[<a id="chap02fn4text"></a><a href="#chap02fn4">4</a>]  But Maximilian's
strictures are probably undeserved, and may be due to the
fact that his tutor restrained him from the study of
history, which he loved, and held him down to Latin
and dialectics, even enforcing them upon his unwilling
pupil by rudely practical methods.  Certainly, if we
may judge by the accounts furnished in Weisskunig,
which seems the most reliable of the books compiled
under Maximilian's supervision, there were but few
pursuits, physical or mental, in which the young
Prince had not his share.  Not merely was he
instructed in the art of war, and in the technical details
of various trades, such as carpentry and founding,
but also in the prevailing theories of statesmanship
and government.  These are quaintly divided by the
young White King under five heads&mdash;the all-mightiness
of God, the influence of the planets on Man's
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P8"></a>8}</span>
destiny, the reason of Man, excessive mildness in
administration, and excessive severity in power; and
his discourse on the subject wins the complete
approval of his father and the wonder of his biographer.
Everything which Maximilian does approaches perfection;
if he fishes, he catches more than other men;
he cures horses of which all the horse-doctors have
despaired; he has few equals as blacksmith or
locksmith.  But though all this is clearly exaggeration, it yet
affords a clue to the accomplishments to which
Maximilian was brought up, and to the manysidedness of
his early training.  There is no doubt as to his
proficiency as a linguist; he could speak Latin, French,
Italian and Flemish fluently, and had some knowledge
of Spanish, Walloon, and English besides.[<a id="chap02fn5text"></a><a href="#chap02fn5">5</a>]  His thirst
for knowledge was almost unquenchable, and
increased with his years&mdash;history, mathematics,
languages, all receiving attention from the Royal student.
But his literary tastes, even in later life, never
superseded his love of manly exercises; and it was no
doubt in his early years that he first acquired that
passion for the chase which never deserted him.  His
marvellous adventures in pursuit of the chamois or
the bear are still remembered in the Tyrolese Alps.
He possessed the most dauntless courage, and is said
to have been one of the finest swordsmen in Europe.
He had few equals at the tourney; and one of the
most romantic incidents of his life was the single
combat at Worms, when, entering the lists in the
simplest of armour, he overcame a famous French
knight, and then, raising his vizor, revealed his
identity amid the deafening plaudits of the crowd.
Nor were his exploits confined to chivalrous
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P9"></a>9}</span>
amusements: time and again he proved his courage on the
field of battle; notably at Guinegate, where "he raged
like a lion in the fight," and later, with characteristic
generosity, devoted himself to dressing the wounds
of the vanquished.  Gallant, chivalrous and versatile,
full of high ideals and noble enthusiasms, he was
formed by nature to be the darling of his age and
nation.
</p>

<p>
Such general characteristics must suffice for a
description of Maximilian's early life, of which we
possess but few details or facts, until the Burgundian
marriage brought him into the full blaze of the
political arena.  This famous event, whose results
are still to be traced in the political conditions of
Europe, was the first step of the House of Hapsburg
towards the "Weltmacht" of Charles V.
</p>

<p>
To Frederick III. belongs the credit of this achievement.
During his long reign of fifty-three years the
Imperial crown lost much of its remaining prestige
and influence; and it is undoubtedly true that
Frederick used his Imperial office for purposes of
Hapsburg aggrandisement.  But he can hardly be
blamed for adopting a policy to which there was no
alternative.  Chosen mainly for his impotence, he
had literally no hold upon the Empire itself, beyond
the largely nominal prerogatives of his office; and he
had good precedent for his scheme of attaining to
real Imperial power by building up a compact
territorial state.  Something must be allowed to a prince
who, with such slight resources as Frederick III.,
could aspire to the proud motto, "Alles Erdreich ist
Oesterreich Unterthan,"[<a id="chap02fn6text"></a><a href="#chap02fn6">6</a>] and who, after years of
disaster and disappointment, succeeded in laying the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
foundations of a greatness which he did not live to
see.  The policy of the Hohenstauffen was no longer
practicable.  The power of the Emperor had all but
vanished, and the sole way of meeting the territorial
tendencies of the great princes was to develop a
territorial power for himself.  The task required a man
of courage and endurance, who should paralyse the
opposing forces by passive resistance; and such a
man was Frederick.  That the Burgundian marriage
was no mere lucky accident, but the fruit of a long
and deliberate policy, is abundantly shown by the
negotiations which preceded the event.  A life-long
struggle against inadequate means effectually soured
the character of the old monarch, but it had not been
wholly in vain; and the marked contrast between
father and son may perhaps account for the unfavourable
light in which Frederick has been viewed by
posterity.
</p>

<p>
The first suggestion of a marriage between
Maximilian and Mary of Burgundy occurs in a letter of
Pius II. to Philip the Good in 1463.[<a id="chap02fn7text"></a><a href="#chap02fn7">7</a>]  The Pope
doubtless hoped that an alliance of Austria and
Burgundy would further his great scheme of a
crusade against the Turks; but even hints of a
kingly title failed to rouse the old Duke's interest in
the proposal, and it seems to have been allowed to
drop.  In 1468 an envoy appeared at the Burgundian
Court, with full powers to treat as to the marriage,
and the election of Charles the Bold as King of the
Romans.  But the latter's soaring ambitions were a
hindrance to the marriage; and when the long
negotiations for the revival of the old Burgundian
kingdom came to nothing in 1474, Frederick's object
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P11"></a>11}</span>
seemed as far from fulfilment as ever.  Throughout
Charles's reign there was a continual danger of the
prize falling to some more favoured suitor.  It was
only when the Burgundian arms first met with
disaster at the hands of the Swiss, that Charles's
day dreams began to be dispelled, and he gave
serious thought to the future of his only child.  A
month after the defeat of Grandson, an Imperial
embassy waited upon the Duke; and on May 6, 1476,
the betrothal of Maximilian and Mary was formally
announced.  In its immediate results, the alliance
was disastrous to Charles; for his desertion by the
Prince of Taranto, one of Mary's disappointed suitors,
the day before the battle of Morat, was one of the
causes of his second defeat by the Swiss.  Charles
now became anxious to hasten on the marriage, and
sent an envoy to obtain his daughter's consent.  On
November 4, he wrote to Frederick begging him and
Maximilian to come with all speed to Koln for the
ceremony;[<a id="chap02fn8text"></a><a href="#chap02fn8">8</a>] and soon after, Maximilian received a
letter from his bride, thanking him for the letter and
ring which he had sent her, and declaring her
agreement with her father.  But now, as ever, Frederick
was tied down by want of money, and the final
catastrophe, when Charles the Bold perished on the
field of Nancy (January 6, 1477), found the
bridegroom quite unprepared for his new and arduous
task.  At a time when so much depended on prompt
action,[<a id="chap02fn9text"></a><a href="#chap02fn9">9</a>] the Emperor contented himself with sending
despatches to the officials and stadtholders of the
Low Countries, urging them to obey none but Mary
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
and Maximilian as her betrothed husband, and
promising to come in person at the earliest possible
date.  Meanwhile, Mary's position was pitiable in
the extreme.  The ungallant citizens of Ghent took
prompt advantage of her weakness by extorting from
her "The Great Privilege": the chief cities refused
to pay taxes; and French agents everywhere incited
the burghers to rebellion.  Louis XI. did not imitate
his cousin of Austria, and lost no time in profiting by
Mary's helpless condition.  In the course of a few
weeks, Picardy, Franche Comté, and the Duchy of
Burgundy were annexed to the French Crown.  King
Louis demanded, almost at the sword's point, the
hand of Mary for the infant Dauphin; and his
ungenerous betrayal of her secret overtures exposed
her to an unpardonable affront at the hands of her
disloyal subjects.  Despite her tears and entreaties,
and before her very eyes, her two most trusted
counsellors were executed by the citizens of Ghent;
and the young Duchess found herself friendless and
alone, at the mercy of the treacherous Louis and her
own rebellious people.  In her distress she turned
naturally to her knight and protector, Maximilian,
whose admirers pictured to her a new Lohengrin
destined at the last moment to restore the desperate
fortunes of Elsa of Brabant.  The romance of this
journey to succour his Princess in distress is
somewhat marred by the long delay which preceded it.
It can only be explained by the money difficulties of
his father, and the intrigues of Matthias of Hungary,
which brought him to the verge of war with Frederick.
Notwithstanding Mary's pressing entreaties[<a id="chap02fn10text"></a><a href="#chap02fn10">10</a>] for his
coming, it was only on May 21 that Maximilian left
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P13"></a>13}</span>
Vienna, and he did not actually reach Ghent till
August 18.  But though this delay was of great
advantage to Louis XI., it may be doubted whether
Maximilian could have effected much, even had he
arrived on the scene at an earlier date.  The Ghentois
were probably hostile to him,[<a id="chap02fn11text"></a><a href="#chap02fn11">11</a>] or sank their opposition
mainly because of the distance of his own dominions.
It was the growing fear of French predominance which
won adherents to his cause, and he found many
supporters among the Flemish nobles, and the party of
the Hoeks.  The old Netherland chronicler gives us
a favourable sketch of Maximilian, when he says:
"Though still a youth, he displayed the true qualities
of a man and a prince.  He was magnanimous, brave
and liberal, born for the good of the race.  His fame
was increased by a countenance of right royal dignity,
the splendour of his father's majesty, the antiquity of
his lineage, and the amplitude of his inheritance."[<a id="chap02fn12text"></a><a href="#chap02fn12">12</a>]
The day after his arrival in Ghent, the marriage
was celebrated by the Legate with great pomp and
rejoicings.

<br />
MARY OF BURGUNDY
</p>

<p>
The young Prince seems at first to have carried all
before him; and as we read the words of an eye-witness
of the proceedings, our charmed fancy pictures
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P14"></a>14}</span>
for us one of the deathless paladins of Charles the
Great.  "Mounted on a large chestnut horse, clad
in silver armour, his head uncovered, his flowing
locks bound with a circlet of pearls and precious
stones, Maximilian looks so glorious in his youth,
so strong in his manliness, that I know not which
to admire most&mdash;the beauty of his youth, the bravery
of his manhood, or the promise of his future.
Man muss ihn gern haben, den glänzenden Mann."[<a id="chap02fn13text"></a><a href="#chap02fn13">13</a>]
From the very first the marriage seems to have
been one of great happiness; and the birth of Philip
(June 1478) set a crown to their affection.  Maximilian
himself gives a happy description of his wife
in a confidential letter to Sigismund Prüschenk:
"I have a lovely good virtuous wife ... She is
small of body, much smaller than 'die Rosina,'[<a id="chap02fn14text"></a><a href="#chap02fn14">14</a>] and
snow-white.  Brown hair, a small nose, a small head
and features, brown and grey eyes mixed, clear and
beautiful.  Her mouth is somewhat high, but pure
and red."[<a id="chap02fn15text"></a><a href="#chap02fn15">15</a>]  Mary was a fine horsewoman, and
excelled at most forms of sport; and this formed an
additional link between them.  "My wife is
thoroughly at home with falcons and hounds; she has a
greyhound of great pace."[<a id="chap02fn16text"></a><a href="#chap02fn16">16</a>]  In all affairs of
Government Mary yielded to her husband, and they remained
in complete accord till the day of her death.  On
Maximilian devolved the task of repelling the French
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
attacks, and we find him complaining of the stress of
business which filled every moment of the day.[<a id="chap02fn17text"></a><a href="#chap02fn17">17</a>]
Infusing his own vigour into his new subjects, and
substantially aided by the Imperial Diet, he was ere
long enabled to take the offensive; and on August 7,
1478, gained a complete victory over the French at
Guinegate.  The personal prowess which Maximilian
displayed, while it helps to explain the estimation in
which he was held, inevitably suggests that he was
more brilliant as a soldier than as a commander.
For so decisive a success, the results were remarkably
small.  Maximilian's sanguine nature induced him to
reject Louis' overtures for peace, and though the tide
of invasion had been rolled back, the most favourable
time for a satisfactory settlement was allowed to pass.
But while Maximilian eagerly awaited the death of the
French King,[<a id="chap02fn18text"></a><a href="#chap02fn18">18</a>] he was himself plunged into mourning
and disaster by the sudden death of Mary
(March 27, 1482).  Filled with the liveliest grief at
his unexpected bereavement,[<a id="chap02fn19text"></a><a href="#chap02fn19">19</a>] he found that at the
same time he had lost control of the source of his
authority; and though recognized by Brabant and
Holland, he met with nothing but opposition from the
refractory Flemings.  Louis XI. could not repress
his delight at the welcome news, and confided to the
sagacious Comines his hopes of Maximilian's
discomfiture.[<a id="chap02fn20text"></a><a href="#chap02fn20">20</a>]  Nor was he mistaken in his forecast of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P16"></a>16}</span>
events.  Without even consulting Maximilian, the
Flemings ratified the Treaty of Arras with Louis XI.
By it the guardianship of Philip was entrusted to the
Estates of Flanders; and the infant Margaret was to
be educated at the French Court as the bride of the
Dauphin Charles.  Artois and Franche Comté, over
which the Flemings had not the slightest legal control,
were calmly ceded as her immediate dowry.[<a id="chap02fn21text"></a><a href="#chap02fn21">21</a>]  To this
humiliating treaty Maximilian had perforce to give his
assent, and it was not till 1485[<a id="chap02fn22text"></a><a href="#chap02fn22">22</a>] that the Flemings
recognized him as the guardian of his son.  Even
then his authority was hedged in by various
conditions; and the young Duke might not be removed
from the country.  Maximilian continued to reside in
the Netherlands; but the favour which he bestowed
on his own countrymen, as well as his influence in
Brabant and Holland, soon rekindled the jealousy of
the Flemings, who accused him of prolonging the war
against France for his own private ends.  He could
not leave the Low Countries without ruining his position
and prospects, and abandoning his children to the
mercy of the Ghent citizens; French agents were
ready to make the most of even a temporary absence;
and he was powerless to assist his father in his
unequal struggle with Matthias.  But even want of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
money or resources does not excuse the indifference
with which he treated the news of Frederick's
misfortunes.  The old Emperor was driven from his
capital, the whole of Lower Austria fell into the
hands of Matthias, and it was only the remonstrances
of Venice which assured to Frederick his Adriatic
provinces.  There was an evident coolness at this
period between father and son, and this was not
removed by Maximilian's dealings with the Electors,
in the hope of securing his election as King of the
Romans.
</p>

<p>
Frederick had been chosen Emperor mainly for his
insignificance, but it was felt that he had played the
part of a nonentity only too well.  There was a
growing inclination to turn from Frederick to Maximilian,
and to shift the duties of the Empire's struggle with
Matthias of Hungary on to the Burgundian possessions
of the Hapsburg House.  Various causes combined
to secure Maximilian's election: but none of
the credit can be assigned to Frederick III., who only
consented to entertain the idea, when he had become
a fugitive from his dominions, and when Maximilian
had promised not to make inroads upon his Imperial
power.  Frederick's manifest dislike of the scheme
was a recommendation with most of the Electors.
Maximilian was welcomed by Albert Achilles and the
old Imperial party, who wished a strong ruler at the
head of the Empire; and his favourable attitude
towards Reform won favour with the party of Berthold
of Henneberg, the great Elector of Mainz.  The
opposition of France and Hungary was met by the
secrecy of the Electors; and their choice was
announced almost before the suspicions of Uladislas
had been aroused (February 16, 1486).  Frederick
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span>
is said to have wept feebly at the news, but
elsewhere the announcement gave rise to the most
sanguine anticipations; and the gorgeous ceremonial of
his coronation at Aachen made a sensible impression
upon the popular mind.  The proclamation of a ten
years' Landfriede throughout the Empire, which was
the new King's first act, was perhaps better
calculated to please the Reforming party than the rank
of the knights, whose brightest ornament Maximilian
was held to be; yet it seemed to augur well for a
new era of peace and order.
</p>

<p>
In 1488[<a id="chap02fn23text"></a><a href="#chap02fn23">23</a>] a new instrument was devised for the
enforcement of the Landfriede.  The private feuds, so
frequent and so ruinous in mediaeval times, were now
falling into disuse, but only because the general
unrest took larger forms.  Leagues and Unions
superseded the looser ties of warlike neighbours, and
whole districts became involved in the settlement of
some contemptible quarrel.  The Swiss Confederacy
was in reality a development of this system of
Leagues, its primary object being protection against
the House of Hapsburg.  Every access of strength
on the part of the Swiss, and especially the prestige
which their triumph over Charles the Bold had won
them, tended to weaken the Hapsburg influence in
Swabia, the cradle of their race, and their mainstay in
the Empire.  Thus, when in 1486 the Bavarian Dukes
directly infringed the Landfriede by their seizure of
Regensburg,[<a id="chap02fn24text"></a><a href="#chap02fn24">24</a>] the moment seemed favourable for some
fresh organization, which should preserve the peace
of the Empire and at the same time restore the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
waning Hapsburg power in Swabia.  In July 1487
an invitation was issued in the name of Frederick and
Maximilian to all the nobles, knights, prelates and
cities of Swabia, to a meeting at Esslingen.  This
step resulted in the formation of the famous Swabian
League.  Though really a development of the League
of St. George's Shield, whose captain, Count Hugo
von Werdenberg, was the chief originator of the
scheme, it differed from it by extending its
membership from the ranks of the nobles of all orders and
classes of the Empire.  A confederate Council and
Court of Justice were instituted, and expenses were
allotted for the raising of an army of 12,000 foot
and 1,200 horse.  A decisive influence was
preserved to the Emperor, and the League was further
strengthened by the adhesion of such princes as
Sigismund of Tyrol, Eberhard of Würtemberg, and
the Electors of Mainz and Trier.  The Swabian
League remained for many years a leading factor in
German affairs.  Though it widened the gulf between
the Swiss and the members of the Empire (and thus
no doubt was partly responsible for the Swiss war of
ten years later), it also checked the gradual drifting of
single towns from the Imperial to the Swiss system.
And still more, it gave the Hapsburgs a strong
weapon of defence against the House of Wittelsbach,
whose aggressive policy might, without it, have
proved entirely successful.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, so far from Maximilian realizing the
hopes of the Electors by bringing the forces of the
Netherlands to the aid of the Empire, it was not
very long ere Imperial troops were needed to rescue
him from the hands of his turbulent subjects.  He
was rapidly becoming unpopular among the Netherlands,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P20"></a>20}</span>
whose constitutional traditions were vitally
opposed to his dynastic plans; and the French
Government, strong in Flemish sympathy, renewed the
war with greater vigour and success.  Maximilian's
first organized body of landsknechts was completely
defeated at Bethune, and afterwards roughly handled
by their nominal allies.  The final outbreak was largely
due to a commercial treaty between Maximilian and
Henry VII., which closed the Flemish harbours to
English products.  As a result, a lively commercial
intercourse in English cloth sprang up in the coast
towns of Brabant, and the economic rivals of
Flanders reaped a rich harvest.  The French
Government fanned the flame of Flemish disaffection.
It declared Maximilian to have forfeited the
French fief of Flanders, and formally absolved this
country from all allegiance to him.  His refusal to
account for the expenditure of the public money was
an additional grievance; and when a rash visit to
Bruges, with but a slender escort of troops, placed
him in their power, the burghers used their advantage
to the full.  The morning after his entry a sudden
insurrection took place (February 10, 1488).  The
whole town was soon up in arms, the gates were
seized, and the Ducal palace was stormed by an
excited mob.  Maximilian himself was removed to the
Kranenburg, and closely guarded; his councillors
were racked in the public square, some of his chief
adherents were beheaded, and the citizens of Ghent
and Bruges united in depriving him of the Regency,
and forming a new government wholly subservient
to France.  For three months he remained in this
perilous condition, in continual fear of death or
betrayal to Charles VIII.  Kunz von der Rosen, his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P21"></a>21}</span>
faithful jester, who shared his captivity, begged
Maximilian to exchange clothes with him and thus
escape from the city in disguise; but the latter
refused to expose him to almost certain death at the
hands of the infuriated mob.  Maximilian's letter to
his father and the Electors shows the imminent
danger in which he lay.  "They will give me poison
to eat, and so kill me ... they are taking all my
people from me; this is my last letter for good and
all ... I beseech you, in the name of God and
Justice, for counsel and aid."[24a]  For once Frederick's
sluggish nature was fully roused, and, relinquishing
all other objects, he moved heaven and earth to
obtain his son's release.  Over 20,000 men answered
to the Imperial summons to Koln, and by the middle
of May this army was advancing on Liège.  The
news of its approach brought the rebels to reason,
and led them to hasten on negotiations with
Maximilian.  Without awaiting the liberating army,
he gave his consent to the most humiliating terms,
and solemnly pledged himself not to repudiate the
agreement.  By it he was to win the consent of the
Emperor and Electors, and to withdraw all foreign
troops from the Netherlands within eight days.  He
renounced, for Flanders, the guardianship of Philip,
and acceded to the formation of a Council of
Regency and to a peace with France (May 16).  On
the strength of these promises he was liberated, and
joined his father's army at Liège.  Frederick and the
Princes refused to recognize any such agreement;
it was declared invalid and contrary to his coronation
oath, on the ground that the Flemings were subjects
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P22"></a>22}</span>
of the Empire;[<a id="chap02fn25text"></a><a href="#chap02fn25">25</a>] and Maximilian, weakly yielding to
their pressure, contented himself with returning the
55,000 groschen which had been granted him to
lessen the bitterness of the pill.  The march was
resumed, and Ghent was closely invested.  But as
usual the old Emperor effected little or nothing, the
town made a vigorous defence, and Maximilian was
glad to avail himself of events in Germany, which
claimed his attention.  It is useless to attempt to
justify his repudiation of his oath, for he had carefully
precluded himself from all lawful methods of evasion.
It leaves a deep stain upon his honour, and the most
that can be said for him is that it is the one
indefensible action of his life.
</p>

<p>
After an absence of twelve years[<a id="chap02fn26text"></a><a href="#chap02fn26">26</a>] Maximilian
returned to the Empire in December 1488, leaving
Duke Albert of Saxony as his representative in the
Netherlands.  The latter showed his zeal by his
promise "so to serve his master that men should
write of it for 1,000 years," and displayed great
ability both as a commander and an organizer.  The
cause of peace was furthered by the Treaty of
Frankfort (July 7, 1489), in accordance with which
Charles VIII. was to use his influence with the
Flemings, and an interview was to be arranged
between him and Maximilian for the settlement of the
Burgundian question.  As a result of this treaty,
Flanders again recognized Maximilian as lawful
Regent and guardian of his son, and granted him the
sum of 300,000 gold thalers in token of their submission.
</p>

<p>
The readiness with which Charles VIII. concluded
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
peace was due to the recent turn of affairs
in Brittany, to which country his rivalry with
Maximilian was now transferred.  During the
aggressive war waged by France in the Netherlands the
King of the Romans had found a natural ally in the
Duke of Brittany, who dreaded the expansive policy
of the French King.  The death of Francis II. (September,
1488) left the Breton throne to his young
daughter Anne; and Ferdinand V. and Henry
VII. united to protect her against her dangerous
neighbour.  But this protection was on the whole rather
sympathetic than practical; and the insecurity of her
position led the young Duchess to search the political
horizon for some efficient defender.  She turned to
Maximilian as the sovereign most interested in resistance
to France and most likely to afford her practical
aid.  It seemed as though the romantic episode of
his first marriage was to be re-enacted in a new
quarter.  On March 20, 1490, Anne and Maximilian
were betrothed, and towards the end of the year the
marriage was formally celebrated by proxy.[<a id="chap02fn27text"></a><a href="#chap02fn27">27</a>]  Anne
openly assumed the title of Queen of the Romans,
and Maximilian's diplomacy was for the time
triumphant.  But the acquisition of Brittany was a matter
of supreme importance to the French Crown; and
Charles VIII. strained every nerve to secure the
discomfiture of his rival.  Brittany was overrun by
French troops, Nantes surrendered after a feeble
resistance, and Anne found herself closely besieged
in Rennes, with little prospect of timely relief, and
with a strong French faction within the walls.
Maximilian's hands were tied down by the necessities
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
of the Hungarian war, and, confident in the
validity of his union with Anne, and relying on the
promised aid of Henry VII., he stirred not a muscle
in her defence.  At last Anne found herself forced to
come to terms.  Brittany was to remain in the hands
of the French, and free passage was granted to her
through French territory, on her way to join
Maximilian.  But her feeling as a Princess overcame her
feeling as a woman.  She was naturally reluctant to
leave her ancestral dominions in hostile hands for
the sake of a man whom she had never seen and who
was her senior by seventeen years; and her offended
pride at Maximilian's inexcusable absence at her time
of need led her footsteps to Chateau Langeais rather
than to the German frontier.  The cunning Charles
had all prepared, and was able to produce the double
dispensation of Innocent VIII.[<a id="chap02fn28text"></a><a href="#chap02fn28">28</a>]  On December 6,
1491, the marriage of Charles VIII. and Anne of
Brittany was duly solemnized at Langeais, and
Brittany was finally incorporated with France.
</p>

<br />
ANNE OF BRITTANY
</p>

<p>
Maximilian, mainly owing to his dilatory conduct,
thus found himself exposed to the most unpardonable
of insults at the hands of a mere stripling.  Not merely
had Charles VIII. deprived him of his lawful wife
and her inheritance, but in so doing he repudiated
Maximilian's daughter Margaret, who, since 1482, had
been educated at the Court of Charles as the future
Queen of France.  To aggravate matters, Charles
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
showed no inclination to restore Margaret's
magnificent dowry, which consisted of Artois, Picardy and
Franche Comté.  Nothing could exceed Maximilian's
indignation, and, full of threats of vengeance, he
entered into an offensive alliance against France with
the Kings of England and Spain.
</p>

<p>
But the acquisition of Brittany had set a seal to
the internal consolidation of France, and Charles,
having deprived his enemies of an excellent base for
hostile operations, was now free to indulge in his
golden dreams of foreign conquest.  No concession
was thought too great to secure the neutrality of his
neighbours.  Henry VII. was bought off by hard
cash and by the promise of a yearly pension;
Ferdinand was appeased by the cession of the coveted
provinces of Roussillon and Cerdagne.  Maximilian,
whose troops were meeting with some success in
Franche Comté,[<a id="chap02fn29text"></a><a href="#chap02fn29">29</a>] saw himself deserted by his allies,
and consented to pocket his outraged dignity in return
for the substantial concessions of the Peace of Senlis
(May 23, 1493).  His daughter Margaret was restored,
and the French evacuated Franche Comté, Artois and
Nevers, in favour of the young Archduke Philip.

<p>
With the Breton incident we reach the close of
Maximilian's Western career, and are free to
examine the events which engaged his attention
while Charles VIII. was robbing him of his bride.
The exigencies of Hapsburg policy and of his
imperial office now draw him into all the various
currents of European diplomacy, and it is hardly to
be wondered at, if his personality is sometimes lost
sight of in an attempt to connect the intricate threads
of contemporary politics.  Maximilian the man and
the chevalier must be our subject, rather than
Maximilian the politician.  The kaleidoscope of political
combinations must be left to a Sismondi or a Creighton.
For it is from the description of his earlier
years and of his later relations to Humanism and
Art that we gain the truest insight into the charm
and fascination of his character&mdash;the romantic
incidents which made the nation mourn him as
the Last of the Knights, and the versatility which
dazzled the eyes of so many brilliant contemporaries.
</p>

<p>
On his return to the Empire, Maximilian found
that his presence was urgently needed in Tyrol,
where Duke Sigismund, after a long reign of folly and
mismanagement, could hardly restrain the general
discontent in his dominions from open expression.
The incapable old Duke had in later life fallen
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P27"></a>27}</span>
completely under the power of his mistresses, who
played upon his superstitions by incantations and
witch-processes, and who squandered the revenues
on their own worthless ends.[<a id="chap03fn30text"></a><a href="#chap03fn30">30</a>]  His life-long hatred
of Frederick III., which even the cession of
Vorder-Austria (1463) could not remove, filled him with the
idea that his cousins wished to deprive him during
his lifetime, and inclined him towards the Bavarian
Court, which eagerly furthered the misunderstanding.
The sale of Burgau (1486) to Duke George the Rich
called attention to the possibility of Sigismund leaving
his possessions outside the Hapsburg family.  Bavaria
was again responsible for Sigismund's war with
Venice; and when defeat came and money failed, the
Duke was obliged to sell all the Vorder-Austria lands
to Dukes Albert and George on terms which made
recovery doubtful.  The Austrian party in Tyrol now
insisted upon the summons of a Diet, and the
Estates subjected Sigismund to an "Ordnung," by
which, in return for the payment of his debts, he
was restricted to a limited expenditure every year.
In the event of his violation of this Ordnung, the
Estates were at liberty to choose another Prince from
the House of Austria.  The Dukes of Bavaria had
been brought to reason by the formation of the
Swabian League, and raised no serious opposition to
this blighting of their hopes.  As was to be expected,
six months had not elapsed ere Sigismund had broken
through the Ordnung; while Albert of Bavaria put
in a demand for 100,000 florins, in recompense for the
sinking of his claims.  This development brought
the old Emperor to Innsbruck, whither he was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P28"></a>28}</span>
followed in April 1489 by Maximilian.  The latter, who
entertained more friendly feelings than his father
towards Bavaria, maintained a mediatory position.
At last, on March 16, 1490, the long-desired step was
taken.  Sigismund made a formal renunciation of
Tyrol, and all his other dominions in favour of
Maximilian, contenting himself with a fixed income and
free rights of hunting and fishing.  Almost at the
same time Maximilian was recognized heir by Count
Bernard of Görz.
</p>

<p>
But by that irony of fate which pursued him
throughout life, Maximilian was never permitted to
finish any one thing thoroughly.  Time and again we
see him ruined by an excess of alternatives, and by
his inability to devote himself exclusively to one out
of many objects.
</p>

<p>
Less than a month after Sigismund's abdication, the
death of Matthias Corvinus diverted Maximilian's
attention to those ancestral dominions from which
his father had been so ignominiously expelled, and
justified him in the hope of restoring the old Hapsburg
influence over Hungary.  Frederick's claim to the
latter kingdom was based on the agreement of 1463,
ratified by Matthias and the leading Magyar nobles,
by which Frederick or his son was to succeed, if
Matthias should die childless.  Though this condition
was now fulfilled, the Hungarians were by no means
disposed to act upon it; and Uladislas, King of
Bohemia, was a dangerous rival to the Hapsburgs,
both by reason of the nearness of his dominions and
the strength of his hereditary claims.[<a id="chap03fn31text"></a><a href="#chap03fn31">31</a>]  Several causes
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P29"></a>29}</span>
combined to handicap Maximilian.  His father, with
his usual jealousy, refused to waive his rights in favour
of Maximilian, who alone was capable of carrying the
enterprise to a successful issue.  Want of money, his
curse throughout life, told heavily against him; nor was
any assistance to be obtained from the German Princes
without concessions on the Emperor's part, and these
Frederick stubbornly declined to make.  Finally,
Austria claimed first attention, and till it had been
recovered, Uladislas was left unassailed in Hungary.
</p>

<p>
Whatever might be the feeling in the latter country,
there was no doubt as to the popularity of Maximilian's
cause in Austria.  Great enthusiasm prevailed,
and his advance was as rapid and bloodless as it was
triumphant.  Vienna University declared unanimously
in his favour, and, by the end of June, 12,000 men had
enlisted in his service.  In July Maximilian entered
Graz, and on August 19, made his triumphal entry
into Vienna, which had been hastily abandoned by
the Hungarian forces.[<a id="chap03fn32text"></a><a href="#chap03fn32">32</a>]  The oath of allegiance was
taken to Maximilian only: the citizens remembered
Frederick too well to entrust themselves a second
time to his mismanagement.  Meanwhile Uladislas
had been proclaimed King of Hungary on July 15,
1490,[<a id="chap03fn33text"></a><a href="#chap03fn33">33</a>] and in September was crowned at Stuhlweissenburg.
Maximilian on this occasion displayed great
activity, and, aided by a liberal grant of money from
the Tyrolese Estates, invaded Hungary at the head of
an army of about 17,000 men.  Crossing the Raab late
in October, he met with but slight opposition; Uladislas
was unprepared, and by nature averse to energetic
measures; and the invader was joined by a number
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P30"></a>30}</span>
of Hungarian magnates.  But this phenomenal success
was fatal to the invaders; and by the time that it
reached Stuhlweissenburg, the army was virtually out
of hand.  In spite of a firm resistance, the city was
cannonaded (Maximilian personally directing the
artillery) and taken by storm; but a disgraceful
scene of plunder and slaughter ensued.  Maximilian
and his captains were quite unable to restrain the
soldiers, and on the next day an open mutiny broke
out.  Their refusal to advance upon Buda, and the
consequent delay, proved fatal to the whole
enterprise.  When summoned to surrender, the capital
indignantly declined, and Uladislas found time to
bring up his Bohemians and to threaten Vienna.
Frederick III., true to his ultra-Fabian motto&mdash;"Mit
der Zeit lohnt oder rächt sich alles"[<a id="chap03fn34text"></a><a href="#chap03fn34">34</a>]&mdash;sent no
assistance, and Maximilian, seeing his base endangered,
and hampered by want of money and discipline, found
it necessary to withdraw westwards.  His overtures
to Poland met with no response, and he was quite
unable to continue the struggle alone.  By July 1491
Stuhlweissenburg fell into the hands of Uladislas, and
all Maximilian's recent conquests were lost.  The
urgent appeals of Reichenburg to Maximilian for
reinforcements and of Maximilian to his father for
money were all in vain.  His position was absolutely
desperate from sheer want of funds,[<a id="chap03fn35text"></a><a href="#chap03fn35">35</a>] while the turn
which Breton affairs were taking seemed to render
peace necessary, at whatever price.  Frederick, who
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
throughout the war had thwarted his aims and
damped his ardour,[<a id="chap03fn36text"></a><a href="#chap03fn36">36</a>] now offered his mediation, and
negotiations were opened in August.  By the Treaty
of Pressburg (November 7, 1491), Uladislas was
formally recognized as King of Hungary, but, failing
his lawful issue, the crown was to fall to Maximilian
or his son.  This promise was to be solemnly ratified
by the Hungarian Estates in presence of the Imperial
envoys.  Moreover, Uladislas renounced all claims
upon Austria, and undertook to refund Maximilian for
the expenses of the war.[<a id="chap03fn37text"></a><a href="#chap03fn37">37</a>]
</p>

<p>
The old Emperor's attitude during the late war had
not improved his relations with Maximilian; and the
friction was rendered the more acute, when
Frederick refused to see his son, and shut off various
sources of income from him, thus seriously injuring
his chances of success against France.  Moreover,
Frederick's hostility to the Bavarian Dukes formed a
marked contrast to Maximilian's conciliatory position,
which was mainly due to the influence of his sister
Cunigunda, wife of Albert IV.[<a id="chap03fn38text"></a><a href="#chap03fn38">38</a>]  Duke Albert's
high-handed conduct in imposing a general tax on his
subjects, in spite of the refusal of the Estates, had led
to the formation of a League of discontented nobles,
known as the Löwlerbund, which united with the
Swabian League and was openly encouraged by the
Emperor.  By the end of 1491 the movement had
ended in hostilities, and on January 23, 1492, Frederick
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
III. published the ban of the Empire against
Duke Albert of Bavaria.  The Swabian League
began to arm.  The French were ready to invade the
Empire, if the League should attack Bavaria.  An
outbreak which would involve the whole of
South-West Germany seemed wellnigh inevitable, and the
entire credit of the preservation of peace, must rest
with Maximilian.  At the last moment, when the
armies were actually encamped and facing each other
in the field, his influence secured an adjustment of the
quarrel.  He had appeased his father's anger by
freeing the Austrian dominions from the oath which they
had taken to himself, and by referring them to the
Emperor as their ruler.  Frederick was now satisfied
with the restoration of Regensburg to the Empire[<a id="chap03fn39text"></a><a href="#chap03fn39">39</a>]
and the cancelling of Bavarian claims on Tyrol; while
a full pardon was granted by Albert to all members of
the Löwlerbund.  (May 1492.)
</p>

<p>
Maximilian, notwithstanding this triumph of his
diplomacy, met with the utmost difficulty in raising
money for his operations against the French; while
a new enemy had arisen in the young Charles of
Egmont, who had recently recovered the Duchy of
Gueldres, and who was destined to be a thorn in
Maximilian's side for the rest of the reign.  Though
his position in West Germany was strengthened by a
League with the "Lower Union,"[<a id="chap03fn40text"></a><a href="#chap03fn40">40</a>] the sole result of
his efforts at the Diet of Coblenz was a prospective
grant of 94,000 gulden, of which only 16,000 actually
came in.  His campaign against the French has
already been sketched (p. <a href="#P25">25</a>).  Scarcely were his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
hands freed by the Peace of Senlis, when an incursion
of the Turks into Styria (August 1493) made a fresh
demand upon his attention.  Then, as usual, the
necessary aid arrived too late, and the marauders
returned home almost unchallenged.  In the midst of
this danger Frederick III., whose health had been
failing for some time, and whose foot it had been
found necessary to amputate,[<a id="chap03fn41text"></a><a href="#chap03fn41">41</a>] died at Linz, in the
seventy-eighth year of his age (August 19, 1493).
</p>

<p>
The old Emperor had lived to see his dreams of
Hapsburg revival and consolidation to a great extent
realized; but his irritable nature had led him to
thwart the family aspirations on Hungary.  In his
dread lest the acquisition of a throne should make his
son more powerful than himself, he afforded him no
assistance, nay rather, threw every hindrance in his
way.  Frederick's death was an undoubted gain to
Maximilian, for it left him Emperor elect and
unquestioned ruler of the Hapsburg dominions.  Family
divisions were no longer possible, since no relative
capable of resistance survived.[<a id="chap03fn42text"></a><a href="#chap03fn42">42</a>]
</p>

<p>
But while his position was rendered more definite
and imposing, there seems to have been at this period
a general cooling of Maximilian's popularity, at least
among the ruling classes.  A powerful party in the
Empire, led by Berthold of Mainz, now claimed the
fulfilment of those promises of reform which he had
made at the Diet of 1489,[<a id="chap03fn43text"></a><a href="#chap03fn43">43</a>] and his reluctance to devote
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P34"></a>34}</span>
his time to its discussion produced a distinctly bad
impression among the Princes.  Moreover, the part
which he now began to play in Italian politics,
exposing, as it did, the Imperial person to indignity and
failure, roused all the old prejudices of the caste of
nobles, and acted as a damper to their enthusiasm.
Gladly as we should avoid threading the intricate maze
of Italian politics&mdash;a task which is after all more apposite
to a general history&mdash;some treatment of Maximilian's
attitude during these momentous years is inevitable,
even in so slight a sketch as the present.  A
general idea of Maximilian's ambitions in Italy will
best be conveyed by his own words.  "Italy has for
centuries experienced what it means for the people, if
no Emperor is there to restrain unruly passions, and
hence the friends of the people have ever looked with
favour on the Imperial power, and longed for the
return of the Emperor."[<a id="chap03fn44text"></a><a href="#chap03fn44">44</a>]

<p>
The fortunes of Milan were at this moment in the
hands of Ludovico il Moro, who, at first merely
Regent for Gian Galeazzo, had retained the whole
powers of government in his own hands, even after
his nephew had come of age.  The young Duke's
wife, Isabella of Naples, deeply resented her
husband's sudordinate position, and Ludovico lived in
terror of intervention on the part of Ferrante and his
Florentine allies.  Hoping to veil the injustice of his
cause under Imperial recognition, he turned to
Maximilian, and offered, in return for his own investiture
as Duke of Milan, the hand of his niece, Bianca
Maria Sforza, and a substantial dowry of 300,000
ducats.[<a id="chap03fn45text"></a><a href="#chap03fn45">45</a>]  So much hard cash seemed to promise to
the needy Maximilian the fulfilment of many a golden
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
dream; and the bride's want of pedigree was atoned
for by the practical possession of her uncle's money
bags.  The marriage was duly celebrated on March
9, 1494, at Halle in Tyrol, when the heir of all the
Caesars linked himself with the granddaughter of a
Romagnol peasant.[<a id="chap03fn46text"></a><a href="#chap03fn46">46</a>]  Thus his first entry into
Italian politics rightly exposed him with justice to the
nickname afterwards bestowed upon him&mdash;Massimiliano
Pochi Danari.  "On the altar of politics the
heart is often the lamb of sacrifice."  Maximilian's
second marriage is not the most creditable episode in
his life.  The luckless Bianca Maria never filled the
place of Mary in her husband's affections, and
remained till her death[<a id="chap03fn47text"></a><a href="#chap03fn47">47</a>] a mere cipher, with next to
no influence over him, and, though never ill-treated,
entirely neglected and overlooked.  The unpopularity
of his marriage in Germany induced Maximilian to
postpone the investiture of Ludovico with the
Milanese, and Gian Galeazzo dying in the interval, the
Emperor was able, with less offence to his conscience,
to fulfil his promise in May 1495.[<a id="chap03fn48text"></a><a href="#chap03fn48">48</a>]
</p>

<p>
Maximilian's first intention was to employ his
wife's dowry in a Crusade against the Turks; and he
plunged eagerly into projects of forming active
alliances abroad and of raising permanent forces at home
to stem the tide of infidel invasion.[<a id="chap03fn49text"></a><a href="#chap03fn49">49</a>]  But disturbing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P36"></a>36}</span>
rumours of the doings of Charles VIII. diverted his
attention to the Italian Peninsula.
</p>

<p>
By the death of Lorenzo de' Medici in 1492, the
balance of power, which his skill had so long preserved
in Italy, was seriously endangered.  The incapable
Piero inclined towards Naples, whose attitude was
now little short of openly hostile to the Milanese
usurper.  Ludovico, in dire need of some influential
ally, made advances to the new Pope and to Venice.
But his alliance with these powers was shortlived:
Spanish diplomacy effected a reconciliation between
Naples and Alexander VI., and Ludovico found himself
more isolated than ever.  The death of the old
King of Naples, in January 1494, hastened events.  The
universal hatred with which his successor, Alfonso II.,
was regarded, while it drove the exiled Barons to
extreme measures, was favourable to the cause of
Ludovico.  He turned naturally to Charles VIII.,
who had recently acquired the Angevin claims to the
throne of Naples, and whose feeble mind was filled
with all the clap-trap of mediaeval chivalry.  The
appeal met with an enthusiastic response: every
other trend of policy was sacrificed that this might
succeed.  By the end of August 1494, all was prepared
for the invasion of Italy, and, with a magnificently
appointed army of 60,000 men, Charles crossed
the Alps and was welcomed by the traitor Ludovico.
Florence opened her gates to the deliverer: the Pope
abandoned Rome at his approach, and looked on in
sullen anxiety from Sant' Angelo; and Naples itself
was occupied amid general rejoicings, almost before a
single blow had been struck.
</p>

<p>
Dazzled by such unprecedented success, Charles
VIII. lost all restraint and began to indulge in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
wildest dreams.  He was to recover Jerusalem, to
eject the infidel from Europe, and to restore in his
own person the fallen Empire of Constantinople.
Rightly or wrongly, he was credited with the
intention of forcing the Pope to crown him Emperor
of the West, or of driving him from the Papal
throne and instituting a thorough reform of the
Church.  Such rumours could not but fill
Maximilian with an uneasiness which Borgia's letters
did not fail to augment.[<a id="chap03fn50text"></a><a href="#chap03fn50">50</a>]  It was only owing
to the skilful diplomacy of Charles' envoys and
his own strained relations with Venice, that he
preserved neutrality for so long as he did.[<a id="chap03fn51text"></a><a href="#chap03fn51">51</a>]  Had not
others taken alarm at the turn of affairs, he might
have prevaricated till the time for action had passed.
Ludovico, who was before all others responsible for
the French expedition, was the first to be disillusioned.
Alarmed at the open designs of the Duke of Orleans
on Milan, he soon became as anxious for Charles' ruin
as he had been eager for his success, and looked for
assistance to his more powerful neighbours.  But
it was Ferdinand of Spain who really brought
about Maximilian's change of policy, by holding
out the tempting bait of a double marriage alliance
with his House.  The Emperor's[<a id="chap03fn52text"></a><a href="#chap03fn52">52</a>] suspicions of
Venice were overcome, and the Signoria became
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P38"></a>38}</span>
the centre of opposition to France.  The various
intrigues were conducted with such skill and
secrecy, that even Comines, who then held the
post of French Ambassador in Venice, was
completely outwitted.  But their details do not leave
us with a favourable impression of the confederates'
straightforwardness.  The itch of the Republic's
patriotic palm was allayed by a promise of the
Apulian ports; while the Pope displayed to the full
his talent for shifty intrigue and prevarication, and
Maximilian kept up a stream of friendly assurances
which effectively duped his young and incapable rival.
</p>

<p>
Thus the proclamation of the Holy League, between
the Pope, Maximilian, Ferdinand, Ludovico and the
Venetians, (March 31, 1495) came upon the French
as a bolt from the blue.  Its ostensible objects were
to defend the Papacy, and to secure peace in Italy
and mutual protection against the attacks of other
Princes.  But from the very first its members made
little attempt to conceal their genuine aim&mdash;the
expulsion of the French from the Peninsula.  The
massing of troops by each of the allies removed all
doubts upon the subject; and Charles VIII. saw
himself compelled to abandon Naples.  On July
6, 1495, ne encountered the forces of the League at
the battle of Fornovo, and after a running
engagement made good his retreat westwards.  Even then
the German and Venetian troops might have inflicted
serious losses on his armies ere they recrossed the
Alps; but the treachery of Ludovico, who concluded
a treaty with Charles without consulting any of his
allies, forced them to retire and leave the French
unmolested.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Maximilian was engaged at the famous
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
Diet of Worms (26 March-August, 1495).  Burning
to strike a blow which might tend to the humiliation of
his rival, he found himself once more, so to speak,
the prisoner of his pocket.  The Electors and the
other Estates were determined that redress should
precede supply, and stubbornly refused to grant a
single florin, until the question of reform had been
placed on a satisfactory basis.  Nor can they be
accused of any want of patriotism; for the interests of
the Empire were by no means coincident with those
of Austria.  Indeed, had not Maximilian's territorial
instincts triumphed so completely over his feelings
as Emperor, he might have been the first to recognize
the deep and sterling patriotism which inspired
the Elector Berthold.  As it was, his first intention
had been to remain fourteen days at Worms, and, after
obtaining the Diet's sanction for the Imperial levies,
to conduct a vigorous campaign against the French.
But here he was met by the practical impossibility
of inducing a body mainly constituted for peace, to
undertake a long and tedious war at a distance.
The feudal system had fallen into decay, and the old
military power of the Empire was no more.  New
circumstances demanded new measures; and the
triumph achieved by a standing army in France
pointed the direction which military reform should
take.  The proposal, then, which Maximilian laid
before the Diet, was for a continuous money aid for ten
or twelve years; with this he might form an army
of landsknechts.  But the Diet was wholly
unsympathetic, and rigidly confined itself to schemes of
reform.  Meetings were sometimes held without
any reference to the Emperor, and, as he indignantly
exclaimed, he found himself treated with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
less consideration than some petty burgomaster.
The struggle of parties lasted throughout the summer,
Maximilian adopting a highly undignified attitude
of sulking.  On three occasions he was particularly
pressing, especially in August, when Novara was
threatened by the Swiss, and a mutiny of the
lands-knechts might be expected, if their pay was not
forthcoming.  At last nothing was left for Maximilian
but submission, and he accepted the Elector Berthold's
proposals for reform.  But Charles VIII. had already
recrossed the Alps, and the time for action was past.
</p>

<p>
Yet, notwithstanding his enforced inactivity,
Maximilian's presence at Worms had not been in vain.
The brilliancy of the Court and the gallant ceremonies
of the lists hid from the casual observer the true
meaning of this great assembly of princes and nobles.
Yet the two important results of Maximilian's policy
form a striking contrast to his humiliation at the hands
of the Electors.  In return for the services of Count
Eberhard, he erected Würtemberg into a Duchy, at
the same time limiting the succession to heirs-male.
Since the hopes of the new ducal family rested upon
one delicate youth,[<a id="chap03fn53text"></a><a href="#chap03fn53">53</a>] this arrangement held out to
Maximilian or his successors the prospect of acquiring
the fair valley of the upper Neckar.  But the other
achievement of his policy was destined to have far
more momentous consequences.  This was the fulfilment
of his agreement with Ferdinand the Catholic,
in accordance with which the Prince of Asturias was
betrothed to Margaret of Austria, and the Archduke
Philip to Joanna of Spain.  By an extraordinary
fatality, the latter marriage, which at the time had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P41"></a>41}</span>
seemed the less important of the two, came to exercise
a vast influence on the history of Europe.  The
Spanish heir died within a year of his marriage
(1497), and Margaret's child lived but a few days.
Isabella Queen of Portugal was now heiress of Castile
and Arragon; but the fates fought against the unity
of the Peninsula.  In 1498 Isabella died, and in 1500
her only child, Prince Miguel, followed her to the
grave.  Philip's wife, Joanna, became heiress of
Spain and all its splendid dependencies in the New
World.
</p>

<p>
Though Maximilian had been thwarted in the hope
of meeting his rival on the open field, the next year
brought a prospect of intervention in Italian affairs.
Charles VIII., on his return to France, had set on foot
preparations for a fresh invasion.  The success of his
overtures to the Swiss Cantons, and the servile
attitude of Florence, filled the Venetians and Ludovico
with alarm; and the two powers invited Maximilian
to make an expedition to Italy in person.  His
eagerness to restore Imperial influence in that country,
coupled with his knightly thirst for renown, led him,
with curious inconsistency, to submit to the indignity
of becoming the pensioner of States whose feudal
superior he claimed to be.  Each promised 30,000
ducats for three months towards the payment of his
troops and engaged a number of Swiss mercenaries
in addition.  The Emperor's sanguine nature already
saw the French party in Italy crushed, and frontier
provinces wrested from the grasp of Charles.  But the
Estates of the Empire, which had been summoned to
meet at Lindau, proved more unmanageable than
ever.  Even had his condottiere-contract not filled
them with disgust, they were wholly disinclined to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
repay his grudging and half-cancelled concessions by
grants of money for an object which the Empire
viewed with indifference.  His penury may be judged
by a letter which he received from his councillors at
Worms, containing an urgent request for more money,
as the maintenance of the courtiers has been stopped,
and the Queen and her ladies will be provided for
"only three or four days more; and if within that
time no money comes, even their food-supplies will
come to an end."[<a id="chap03fn54text"></a><a href="#chap03fn54">54</a>]

<p>
Charles VIII.'s financial straits soon compelled him
to abandon his schemes of active interference in Italy;
and the Signoria, no longer needing Maximilian's
presence, now came to regard him as a positive
hindrance to their aggrandizing policy.  But nothing
could divert him from his project.  When the Venetians
boggled over their promised subsidy, he secured
the necessary sum by loans from the Fuggers.  The
remonstrances of his advisers were of none avail.  At
Augsburg and Linz he divided his time between wild
dreams of conquest with the Archduke Philip, and
the festive entertainments of the citizens.  On
St. John's Eve he led the fairest maiden of the town to
the dance, and gallantly assisted her to kindle the
bonfire, to the sound of drums and cornets and the
merry music of the dance.[<a id="chap03fn55text"></a><a href="#chap03fn55">55</a>]  In July he had an
interview with Ludovico at Munster,[<a id="chap03fn56text"></a><a href="#chap03fn56">56</a>] receiving him
in hunting dress, surrounded by his companions of the
chase; and in the last days of August entered Italy
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
by the Valtelline.  Even then his compact was not
strictly fulfilled.  Instead of the stipulated 7,000 men,
his army never amounted to more than 4,000.  His
first scheme, of driving the French from Asti and
forcing Savoy to join the League, was sacrificed to the
jealousy of Venice, which opposed any increase of
the power of Milan.  Nor were his own relations with
Ludovico distinguished by their cordiality.  The latter
declined to subsidize him unless the Pope and Venice
granted equal amounts, and sought to employ him in
garrisoning the Milanese against French attacks.[<a id="chap03fn57text"></a><a href="#chap03fn57">57</a>]
Finally, Maximilian decided upon an attack on
Florence, and as a preliminary laid siege to Livorno,
curtly informing Ludovico that if he would not provide
money for his troops he had better dismiss them to
their homes.[<a id="chap03fn58text"></a><a href="#chap03fn58">58</a>]  But the numbers of the besiegers were
insufficient for the task, the Venetians held aloof, and
the French garrison never lost entire command of
the sea.  The arrival of a fleet from Marseilles
removed Maximilian's last hopes of reducing the city;
his resources were by now exhausted, and, declaring
that "against the will of God and men he would not
wage this war," he hurriedly retired northwards.
He turned a deaf ear to the entreaties of the Papal
Legate,[<a id="chap03fn59text"></a><a href="#chap03fn59">59</a>] and before Christmas was again in Tyrol.
According to the Italian wits, not even hunting
invitations could detain the disappointed monarch.  In
short his conduct presents a favourable opportunity
for introducing the cricitisms of Quirini, one of the first
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
of that line of brilliant ambassadors, whose diplomacy
prolonged the existence of Venice till modern times.
"He is of excellent parts, and more fertile in
expedients than any of his advisers, yet he does not know
how to avail himself of any single remedy at the right
moment; while he is as full of ideas and plans as he is
powerless to execute them.  And though two or three
methods lie open to his intellect, and though he
chooses one of them as the best, yet he does not
pursue this, because before its fulfilment another design
which he considers better has suddenly presented
itself.  And thus he flits from better to better, till both
time and opportunity for execution are past"![<a id="chap03fn60text"></a><a href="#chap03fn60">60</a>]  Yet
with all his indecision and want of perseverance, he
was resigned and cheerful in adversity, and it was
perhaps at this period that he consoled himself with
the assurance "Gott sorgt schon: es könnte noch
schlimmer gehen."[<a id="chap03fn61text"></a><a href="#chap03fn61">61</a>]
</p>

<p>
Maximilian's failure left the French influence
all-powerful in Italy; but Charles VIII. made no further
movement, and his premature death in April 1498
materially changed the situation.  The first act of
Louis XII.&mdash;his infamous divorce from Jeanne of
France, followed by his marriage to Anne of Brittany&mdash;can
hardly have been gratifying news to Maximilian.
Still, the latter hoped to obtain the restoration of
Burgundy from the new King, in return for acquiescence
in the French policy in Italy.  But when his
representations met with no response, he sought aid
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
from the Diet for a war against France.  In spite of
its refusal, and though he might have seen that the
League had no intention of pulling his chestnuts out
of the fire, he threw an army into Burgundy.  But the
Swiss mercenaries, who formed its strength, either
were bribed by Louis or mutinied for want of pay;
while Philip concluded a separate peace with France
(July 2, 1499), actually renouncing the claims which
his father brought forward in his name, and receiving
from Louis XII. the investiture of Artois and Flanders.
The French King was led to conclude this treaty by
his designs upon the Duchy of Milan, which he
claimed as the lawful heir of the Visconti dynasty.
His wise policy of treating the various members of
the League as though it were non-existent was
crowned with success.  Ere long all were pacified but
Maximilian, and he was rendered harmless by systematic
intriguing with the Swiss Confederates&mdash;a policy
which had a perceptible influence in producing the
memorable Swiss war of 1499.  The immediate
causes of the outbreak were incidents of petty friction
on the Tyrolese border; but the real question at issue
was the relation of the Confederates to the Empire.
</p>

<p>
No sooner had the Swiss in earlier days attained
their object of holding directly from the Emperor, than
they made it sufficiently obvious that this dependence
was for the future to be mainly nominal.  During the
long reign of Frederick III. they had enjoyed just
such a state of internal peace and order as the
perpetual Landfriede and the Kammergericht aimed at
securing for the rest of the Empire; and now, when
Maximilian demanded their submission to the decrees
of the Diet of Worms, by contributing men and money
for his schemes of foreign policy, war was practically
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P46"></a>46}</span>
inevitable.  Their close relations with successive
Kings of France had long shown the slight regard
in which they held their nominal ruler.  Their
connexion with the Empire brought them no advantage,
submission to the Common Penny (das Gemeine
Pfennig) naturally appeared a hardship to them, and
the decisions of the Kammergericht they regarded
as assaults upon their treasured freedom.  Their
refusal of Maximilian's demands was coupled with
general steps for union with the sister Leagues of the
Graubünden and the Valais.  The war began with
marauding and skirmishing, growing fiercer and
assuming larger proportions when the Swabian
League armed itself at the Imperial summons.  But
the Swiss everywhere held their own: their superiority
was admitted even by the Count of Fürstenberg,
general of the League, who branded his own troops
as "ein flüchtig, schnöd und ehrlos Volk."  Maximilian
himself had been engaged in unprofitable operations
against the Duke of Gueldres, and only arrived
upon the scene in July, to find matters going against
him.  Even his presence did not turn the balance,
and at Schwaderloch the Swiss, though somewhat
outnumbered, more than held their own.  Only four
days later (July 24), the army of Henry of Fürstenberg,
15,000 to 16,000 strong, suffered a severe defeat at
Dornach at the hands of 6,000 Confederates.  The
Austrian leader, with many distinguished nobles and
about 4,000 men, perished on the field.  This disaster
dealt the final blow to Maximilian's hopes.  At first
he shut himself up in the Castle of Lindau, and refused
to see any of his nobles.[<a id="chap03fn62text"></a><a href="#chap03fn62">62</a>]  But he soon reconciled
himself to the necessity of coming to terms.  The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P47"></a>47}</span>
Treaty of Basel (September 22, 1499), though less
remarkable for its provisions than for its omissions, is
one of the landmarks of Swiss history.  By it mutual
conquests were restored, and Maximilian recovered
the Prättigau, while various small disputes were
referred to arbitration.  But, while Swiss independence
was not formally recognized by the Empire till
a century and a half later, it was tacitly secured by
this treaty; and henceforward the Confederates
enjoyed entire immunity from Imperial jurisdiction
and from Imperial taxation.  Nor was this the only
result of the struggle.  The Swiss had won for
themselves a position which inspired their neighbours with
a genuine admiration and a very wholesome fear.
Respected and courted by the outer world, they
strengthened their position internally by a close union
of the Confederates and the Graubünden.  The
Empire was deprived for ever of a number of its
most valuable subjects,[<a id="chap03fn63text"></a><a href="#chap03fn63">63</a>] and the House of Hapsburg
was finally excluded from the cradle of its greatness.
</p>

<p>
No one reaped fuller advantage from the Swiss war
than Louis XII.  While all the energies of Maximilian
were devoted to coping with the Confederates, he
found himself free to carry into execution his projected
invasion of the Milanese.  Had the Emperor proved
successful, Ludovico might perhaps have saved himself
(or at least prolonged the struggle) by entering
the Swabian League; but with the defeat of Dornach
the usurper's fate was sealed.  Louis XII., who had
already allied himself with the Pope and Venice, winning
the support of the latter by the promise of Cremona,
crossed the Alps at the end of July with an army
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P48"></a>48}</span>
of 22,000 men, and entered Milan almost unopposed.
Ludovico, deserted and betrayed by his people, sought
refuge in Tyrol, and was among the first to bring the
tidings of his own misfortunes to his Imperial nephew.
But though received with the utmost sympathy and
respect by Maximilian, he soon perceived that the
latter was as usual at the end of his resources, and
that no assistance need be looked for from him.  He
purchased the services of 8,000 Swiss mercenaries
and of the celebrated Burgundian guard, and with
their aid recovered his capital and most of its territory.
But the army which Louis XII. despatched to the
assistance of Bayard consisted largely of Swiss troops;
and Ludovico's mercenaries, refusing to fight against
their countrymen in the French service, renounced
his cause and betrayed him to the enemy.  (April
10, 1500).  In this undignified way one of the chief
disturbers of the peace of Italy bids a last farewell to
the field of politics; he remained in the most rigorous
confinement at Loches for the next five years, after
which the earnest intercession of Maximilian secured
some relaxation in his treatment.  He was allowed a
space of several leagues around his prison for hunting
and other amusements, and died in captivity in 1510.
</p>

<p>
On the very day when Ludovico fell into the hands
of the French, Maximilian opened the Imperial Diet
at Augsburg.  His main object was to obtain aid
against France; but the complete failure of his recent
military enterprises&mdash;alike in Burgundy, Gueldres,
Switzerland and Milan&mdash;compelled him to acquiesce
in the formation of a Council of Regency, (Reichsregiment),
which was to discuss all military and financial
affairs, and even questions of foreign policy, which at
that period were considered the special department
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P49"></a>49}</span>
of the Monarch.  This Council consisted of twenty-one
members, of whom sixteen were appointed by the
Electors and Princes, two by the Imperial towns;
while Maximilian nominated two for Austria and
Burgundy, and only one, the President, in his capacity
of Emperor.  The promoters of the scheme aimed at
little short of his abdication; while he, on his part,
cheerfully assumed that they would defer to his
wishes on matters of foreign politics.  The bait held
out to him by Berthold was a permanent war
administration, possessing power both to levy troops and
to impose taxes; from this he promised himself
an army of 30,000 men, and money to maintain it.
But the project remained upon paper, and Maximilian's
disgust was turned to fury when the first step
of the new Council was to conclude a truce with
France, and virtually to commit him to investing
Louis XII. with Milan.  Finding himself helpless in
view of the Diet's opposition, and determined not to
submit to the ruling of the Council, he began to
make separate overtures to the French King.  In this
he was readily encouraged by the Archduke Philip
and by Ferdinand, who was already hatching his
iniquitous plot for the partition of Naples, and who
found Maximilian's hostile attitude to France a drag
upon Louis' action.  In October 1501 the visit of
Cardinal d'Amboise, the trusted adviser of Louis XII.,
to the Court of Innsbruck, brought matters to a final
issue.  A treaty, whose friendliness was only rivalled
by its hypocrisy, was concluded between the two
Monarchs.  The infant Archduke Charles was
betrothed to Louis' daughter Claude; Louis himself
was to receive the investiture of Milan, in return for
the sum of 80,000 crowns, and promised to assist the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P50"></a>50}</span>
Emperor in his journey to Rome and in his projects
against the Turks.  But the actual terms of the
agreement were of little importance, as they were
obviously intended only for momentary ends.  The
conquest of Naples, which was effected in the years
1501-1505, soon led to quarrels between the two
conquerors.  Louis XII.'s continual intrigues with the
German Princes induced Maximilian to support the
Spanish cause by the despatch of 2,500 landsknechts;
and by the end of 1504 the brilliant tactics of the
great Captain resulted in the final expulsion of the
French from the kingdom of Naples.  At the same
time the Emperor found means to check Louis'
intrigues, which the outbreak of the Bavarian war
had rendered dangerous.  By the Treaty of Blois
(September 22), Milan was ensured to Louis XII.,
and, failing heirs-male, to Claude and her youthful
bridegroom Charles.[<a id="chap03fn64text"></a><a href="#chap03fn64">64</a>]  But this agreement, like its
predecessor, was not made to be observed.  No
sooner had d'Amboise obtained Louis' formal
investiture from the Emperor (April 1505), than the
betrothal of Claude to the Archduke was secretly
annulled, and Francis of Angoulême took his place as
her prospective husband.  The death of Isabella the
Catholic, and the struggle of Ferdinand and Philip for
the Castilian Regency, removed all danger of any
united effort between Spain and the Hapsburgs
against France; and early in 1506 Louis' breach of
faith was formally proclaimed and ratified by the
States-General of Tours.[<a id="chap03fn65text"></a><a href="#chap03fn65">65</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P51"></a>51}</span>
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding this rebuff, Maximilian had gained
a very distinct advantage from peace with France.
So long as the question of investiture was pending,
Louis could not interfere in the affairs of the Empire,
and Maximilian was free to profit by the turn of
events.
</p>

<p>
The death of George the Rich, Duke of Bavaria-Landshut
(December 1, 1503), resulted in a disputed
succession.  In spite of a family agreement
(Erbvertrag) which expressly nominated as his heirs Duke
Albert IV. of Munich and his brother Wolfgang, the
old Duke left his lands to his daughter Elizabeth, wife
of Rupert, a younger son of the Elector Palatine.
Both parties prepared to assert their rights, and
Rupert, careless of the consequences, threw himself
into Landshut, thus opening the war, and putting
himself under the ban of the Empire.[<a id="chap03fn66text"></a><a href="#chap03fn66">66</a>]  The Estates
refused allegiance to Albert, and called in Maximilian
as mediator in the quarrel.  The Emperor preferred
to renounce his position of <i>tertius gaudens</i>, and to
throw the whole weight of his support on Albert's
side.  Even had he not already, in 1497, recognized
Albert's title, both justice and his own interests urged
him to the Bavarian side.  The Palatine House had
ever been the foe of the Hapsburgs, and Duke Albert,
as the Emperor's brother-in-law, would naturally
seem the less dangerous of the two claimants.
Maximilian at first offered Rupert a third of George's
possessions, in the hope of averting hostilities; but,
meeting with a curt refusal, he roused the forces of
the Swabian League, and, assisted by Würtemberg,
Brunswick and Hesse, took the field in person at the
head of a considerable army.  The sudden death of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P52"></a>52}</span>
Rupert (August 20, 1504), closely followed by that of
his masculine wife Elizabeth, did not put an end to
the war, the Elector continuing the struggle in the
name of his grandsons.  A fierce encounter took place
near Regensburg between the Imperialists and a large
body of Bohemian mercenaries in the Elector's
service.  Maximilian himself led the right wing to the
charge, and drove the enemy back to their laager,
which, after the example of Zizka, they had
constructed from their baggage waggons.  A desperate
sally for the moment broke the Imperialist ranks, and
he was surrounded and dragged from his horse by
the long grappling hooks attached to the Bohemians'
lances.  He owed his life to the distinguished gallantry
of Eric of Brunswick, who scattered his assailants
when all hope seemed lost.  Rallying his troops, he
led them on to victory, and defeated the enemy with
heavy loss.  This affray was followed up by the
siege of Kufstein, in which the Emperor's artillery
played an important part&mdash;especially two heavy pieces,
which he had christened "Purlepaus" and "Weckauf
von Oesterreich."  The hesitation of the garrison,
which at first made promises of surrender, and then
decided upon resistance, so deeply incensed
Maximilian, that when the inevitable capitulation came,
he refused to show any mercy.  It was only when
half the scanty garrison had been executed that the
intercession of the Princes prevailed to secure pardon
for such as remained (October 17, 1504).  The capture
of Kufstein was the last serious incident of the war.
A truce was concluded in February, 1505, and in
August, when Maximilian appeared at the Diet of
Köln, he was able to dictate his own terms to the
discomfited Elector.  With the exception of Neuburg,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P53"></a>53}</span>
and some territory north of the Danube, which were
formed into an appanage for Rupert's children, all
the lands of George were made over to Bavaria.  But
the Emperor had not conducted the war solely from
the kindness of his heart, and both claimed and
secured a substantial reward for his services.  From
the Palatinate he acquired Hagenau and the Ortenau;
from Bavaria, Kufstein, Rattenberg, and a number of
petty lordships,[<a id="chap03fn67text"></a><a href="#chap03fn67">67</a>] and, most important of all, the
Zillerthal, which gave Tyrol a strong frontier to the
north-east, and rounded off the territories to which
he had succeeded in 1500 on the death of Leonard of Görz.
</p>

<p>
Maximilian's reputation in the Empire was now
perhaps higher than it had ever been before; the
more so, that in the winter of 1504 death had removed
his old opponent, Berthold of Mainz, and that the
new Elector was a near relative of his own.[<a id="chap03fn68text"></a><a href="#chap03fn68">68</a>]  But
when the future was all bright with hope, and when
his coronation at Rome and an union of Spain and the
Empire against the French and the Turks seemed at
last on the point of realization, his golden dreams met
with a rude awakening.  The sudden and premature
death of Philip, who had assumed in person the
government of Castile, and was successfully defending
himself against the spiteful intrigues of Ferdinand,
put an end to the Emperor's projects of Hapsburg
combination (Sep. 25, 1506).  The Catholic King
recovered the Regency, and was soon more powerful
than ever in the Spanish Peninsula.  Maximilian at
first met with no better success in his attempt to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span>
secure the government of the Low Countries.  The
Estates of the seventeen Provinces refused to
recognize his claims to the Regency during the minority
of his grandson Charles, and were encouraged by
Louis XII. in the formation of a Council of Regency.
But internal troubles, and the activity of Charles of
Gueldres, pled his cause more eloquently than any
measures of his own.  On their voluntary submission
to his rule, he appointed William de Croy, Lord of
Chièvres, and Adrian of Utrecht[<a id="chap03fn69text"></a><a href="#chap03fn69">69</a>] as Charles' tutors,
and entrusted the administration to his daughter
Margaret, the widowed Duchess of Savoy, who made
her public entry into Mechlin in July 1507, and who
throughout her rule justified his choice by her
scrupulous integrity and brilliant statesmanship.
</p>

<p>
In the same year, 1507, Maximilian made a fiery
appeal to the Diet assembled at Constance, for
assistance in his schemes of a journey to Rome and the
expulsion of the French from Milan.  After considerable
delay he obtained a grant of 3,000 horse and 9,000
foot for six months, and received a further promise of
6,000 men from the Swiss envoys.  But his sanguine
expectations were once more doomed to disappointment.
The majority of the promised troops never
made their appearance; French gold won over his
Swiss allies;[<a id="chap03fn70text"></a><a href="#chap03fn70">70</a>] and the Estates of his own dominions
outdid all previous occasions in their parsimony.
Meanwhile his ardent preparations had roused the
distrust of Venice, which refused him passage through
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
her dominions, unless he restricted himself to a trifling
escort.  His army was too weak to force its way either
through Milanese or through Venetian territory; and
hence he was driven to an expedient which involved
a break with the old mediaeval traditions of the
Empire.  On February 4, 1508, he had himself
proclaimed with great pomp and solemnity, in the
Cathedral of Trent, as Holy Roman Emperor.  It was
declared that for the future in all official documents
he should be known by the title of "erwählte
römischer Kaiser," but that for convenience sake he
should commonly be called "Emperor."  Julius
II. raised no objection, partly because Maximilian fully
acknowledged the Papal right to crown him, and still
more because his arrival in Rome with an army would
have been a most unwelcome event.  Maximilian's
step was the first departure from the immemorial
custom of his predecessors; but with the exception of
his grandson, Charles V., not one of his successors
in the Empire received his crown at the hands of the
Pope.
</p>

<p>
The refusal of Venice to grant a passage to the
Imperial army accentuated the ill-feeling which had
long existed between Maximilian and the Republic.
Now that his ambitions could find no outlet to the
South, he turned his gaze Eastwards, and rashly
embroiled himself with his powerful neighbour.
Within a month of his assumption of the Imperial
dignity, his troops were advancing into Venetian
territory from three different directions, threatening
Vicenza, the valley of the Adige, and Friuli.
Maximilian gives expression to his rosy dreams of victory
in a letter to the Elector of Saxony: "The Venetians
paint their lion with two feet in the sea, the third on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P56"></a>56}</span>
the plains, the fourth on the mountains.  We have
almost won the foot on the mountains, only one claw
is wanting, which with God's help we shall have in
eight days; then we mean to conquer the foot on the
plains too."[<a id="chap03fn71text"></a><a href="#chap03fn71">71</a>]  But the very day after this confident
epistle was penned, Trautson, one of his best captains,
was routed and killed by the Venetians, with a total
loss of over 2,000.  The Venetians now took the
offensive in earnest, and, superior both in numbers
and discipline, completely turned the tables on the
Imperialists.  Town after town fell before their
advance, and by the end of June, Görz, Pordenone,
Adelsberg, Trieste were in their hands; while the
fleet seized Fiume and overawed the whole of Istria.
As soon as the tide began to turn, Maximilian had
hastened back to Germany, to rouse the Electors and
the Swabian League, but from neither could he
obtain any real assistance.  The whole brunt of the
defence fell upon the Tyrolese, who responded
manfully to the call, and checked the Venetian advance at
Pietra, on the way to Trent.  But any prolonged
resistance was hopeless; and Maximilian saw himself
obliged to conclude a three years' truce with the
Republic, by which the latter retained all her
conquests except Adelsberg.
</p>

<p>
The Emperor's humiliation at the hands of Venice
only served to augment the suspicion and dislike with
which she was regarded by her other neighbours.
The Pope felt an especial grudge against her, as the
possessor of Ravenna and Rimini, which lawfully
belonged to the Holy See.  Already in the summer of
1507 he had been feeling his way towards a coalition,
by an attempt to restore friendly relations between
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P57"></a>57}</span>
Louis and Maximilian; but the latter was then still
too full of schemes for the recovery of Milan to
entertain the proposal.  When however he engaged in war
with Venice, he sent agents of his own accord to
Louis XII.  The latter at first refused all
accommodation unless Venice were included; but when the
Republic neglected to include Gueldres in the truce,
he availed himself of this flimsy excuse to negotiate
with the Emperor.  An active exchange of views
followed between Margaret and her father, both as
to an agreement with France, with regard to which
he trusted largely to her judgment,[<a id="chap03fn72text"></a><a href="#chap03fn72">72</a>] and the
proposed marriage of Charles with Mary of England, to
which he would only consent in return for a
substantial loan.[<a id="chap03fn73text"></a><a href="#chap03fn73">73</a>]  Maximilian himself arrived in the
Netherlands in August, but does not seem to have
visited his daughter.  When the crisis of the negotiations
was reached he still remained in the background,
and deputed Margaret and his councillor, Matthew
Lang,[<a id="chap03fn74text"></a><a href="#chap03fn74">74</a>] to receive the French envoys at Cambrai.
D'Amboise raised so many difficulties that at length
Margaret threatened to return home, declaring that
they were merely wasting time.[<a id="chap03fn75text"></a><a href="#chap03fn75">75</a>]  This firm attitude
brought the French envoys to reason, and on
December 10, 1508, the memorable League of
Cambrai was duly ratified.  Ostensibly it was a
renewal of the treaties of 1501 and 1504, with the
exception of the betrothal of Claude and Charles.
But its genuine aim was the complete partition of the
Venetian land-Empire between the four
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P58"></a>58}</span>
arch-conspirators.  The Pope was to receive the towns of the
Romagna, Ferdinand the Apulian seaports.  Maximilian
was to recover all his lost territories and to
supplement them by Verona, Padua, Vicenza, Treviso
and Friuli; while Louis XII. should occupy Brescia,
Bergamo and Cremona.  The Imperial conscience,
which felt some scruples at so prompt an infringement
of the truce, was salved by the commands of
Julius II., who bade him, as protector of the Church,
take part in the recovery of her lands.  Further, to
veil the iniquity of the agreement, the Pope
excommunicated Venice and all its subject lands.
</p>

<p>
Though Maximilian thus isolated Venice, and made
it possible to recover his lost territory, yet his
adhesion to the League was an undoubted political
error.  Not only did his action assist the destruction
of the only power in North Italy capable of resisting
the foreigner, and thus directly lead to the establishment
of French predominance in Lombardy; but it
also implanted in the minds of the Signoria that
irremovable distrust of his intentions which was
responsible for many of his later misfortunes, and which
the pursuance of a straightforward policy might have
averted.  Had he exercised but a moderate amount
of foresight, he would have realized that Louis, with
his vast superiority in power and resources, would
sooner or later discard his needy ally and reserve the
lion's share for himself.  It is probable that the false
glamour and vanity of the Imperial tradition obscured
his eyes to the fact of his own weakness; and what
from one point of view is his strength&mdash;his unquenchable
hopefulness and buoyancy of spirit&mdash;here proved
his weakness and egged him on to defeat and humiliation.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P59"></a>59}</span>
</p>

<p>
Leaving the Netherlands after a year's residence,
Maximilian repaired to the Diet of Worms (April,
1509).  Never before had the Estates been so
unanimous in refusing all support and loading him with
complaints.  The cities were enraged at the
practical supersession of the Council of Regency, the
Princes at his negotiating without their consent.
After mutual recriminations, they separated without
effecting anything; and their dispersal marks the end
of all genuine attempts at Reform.  Even Maximilian's
hereditary Estates voted far fewer men than he had
expected, and qualified even this grant by making the
troops liable to service only when he was personally
in command.  He thus found himself involved in a
serious war, without having sufficient resources to
execute his far-reaching designs, and was reduced to
pledge tolls, mines, and other sources of revenue in
order to raise money.
</p>

<p>
The first great incident of the war was the Battle
of Agnadello (May 14, 1509), in which the Venetians
suffered defeat at the hands of the French.  The
Papal troops occupied Ravenna and the rest of the
Romagna, while Ferdinand added the Apulian ports
to his new dominions.  For the first and last time
Venice made Maximilian a really advantageous
offer: all his lands should be restored, the Imperial
suzerainty should be recognized, and a handsome
yearly subsidy paid down.  But the envoys of the
Republic were not even allowed to approach him, and
about midsummer the Emperor opened the campaign
in person with 15,000 men.  The Venetians had
drawn off the mass of their troops to meet the
French advance, and he was virtually unopposed.
By the middle of July he had recovered all that he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
had lost, and occupied in addition Verona, Vicenza,
Padua, Bassano and Feltre.  He had already fetched
some heavy artillery over the Brenner to reduce
Treviso, when the complexion of affairs was suddenly
and completely reversed.  The inhabitants of the
invaded districts remained loyal to the Venetians, and
so many of the Imperial troops were required to
check their harassing movements that the towns
were insufficiently garrisoned.  The Pope and
Ferdinand, their own objects once attained, grew
indifferent to the progress of the League, and the
Venetians bravely rallied and by a sudden movement
regained possession of Padua.  The Emperor,
leaving Treviso, laid siege to Padua with some 22,000
men, and employed his heavy ordnance with
considerable effect.  But the numbers of the garrison
prevented him from maintaining a complete blockade;
and when two brilliant and determined assaults had
failed to reduce the town, he raised the siege and
returned to Tyrol (October).  He himself explains his
action by the great number of troops and artillery
inside, by the wonderful strength of the defences, and
by the lukewarm spirit of his own troops.[<a id="chap03fn76text"></a><a href="#chap03fn76">76</a>]  But the
main reasons are to be found in the short period for
which the troops were voted, and the entire lack of
money to win them for further services.  Even in
August the Emperor was pawning "deux couliers
d'or garniz de beaucop de bonnes et riches pierres,"
and a number of other valuable jewels.[<a id="chap03fn77text"></a><a href="#chap03fn77">77</a>]  The
Venetians quickly recovered all places of any importance,
with the solitary exception of Verona, which was
defended by a mixed garrison of Germans, French and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P61"></a>61}</span>
Spaniards.  Maximilian, at the end of his resources,
threw himself unreservedly into the hands of Louis
XII.  The Diet of Augsburg, which met in January,
1510, would have acted wisely in strengthening his
hands; for, now that there was a danger of both
Italy and the Papacy becoming dependent upon
France, it was more than ever to the interests of
Germany to hold a strong position south of the Alps.
In spite of his rash onsets without adequate preparation,
Maximilian had a strong sense of the greatness
of the Empire, and was pre-eminently fitted to rouse
the patriotism of Germany in a struggle against the
foreigner.  The Diet did, it is true, vote 1,800 horse
and 6,000 foot for six months, but it had taken four
months to make up its mind to the sacrifice, and
even then the troops never arrived.  Meanwhile the
League had broken up.  Julius II., once in possession
of the Romagnan cities, devoted himself to the
problem of "the expulsion of the barbarian."  With
this end in view, he removed the ban from the
Republic (February, 1510) and concluded a five years'
league with the Swiss, who were to send 6,000
mercenaries to his aid.  In July the Papal and Venetian
armies assumed the offensive, and the latter were
able to reoccupy Friuli.  But Julius met with disaster
on all sides; Maximilian and Louis won over the
Swiss to inactivity, and Henry VIII., on whose
aid the Pope had reckoned, made peace with France.
Maximilian's attitude towards Venice was fiercer and
more hostile than ever, and led him to encourage the
Pasha of Bosnia to attack her Adriatic possessions.
He himself declares that he hopes soon "to carry out
some fine exploit and execution against our enemy;
for it is not enough to put them to death by the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P62"></a>62}</span>
hundred: we must dispose of them by the
thousand."[<a id="chap03fn78text"></a><a href="#chap03fn78">78</a>]  Julius was driven to modify or conceal his
contemptuous opinion of the Emperor, whom he had
treated to the nick-name of "a naked baby."[<a id="chap03fn79text"></a><a href="#chap03fn79">79</a>]  For
it was mainly through the latter's influence that the
Congress of Mantua was arranged, and attended by
the envoys of France, Spain, England and the Pope
(March 1511), the primary object being the
restoration of the League against Venice.  Earnest
negotiations were also conducted at Bologna between the
Pope and Matthew Lang, who loyally resisted the
bribes of a cardinal's hat from Julius and of large
subsidies from Venice.  The disproportion between
the demands of the Emperor and the Republic was
too great to be overcome, and the Pope's hopes of
winning Maximilian to his League were frustrated.
Still powerless by himself, Maximilian was more than
ever dependent on the French, and played a
somewhat subordinate part in the operations of Louis
against the Venetians.  A despatch which he
received from Trivulzio shows us in what scanty
consideration he was held by the French commander.
Referring to the capture of Mirandola by a German
captain, he declares that "it has thrown me into a
worse humour than I have been in during my life,"
and denounces the Imperialists in the most outspoken
fashion.[<a id="chap03fn80text"></a><a href="#chap03fn80">80</a>]
</p>

<p>
The sudden illness of Julius II. (August 1511),
from which a fatal issue was generally expected, led
to an episode, which, though trivial in itself and void
of result, gives us a vivid impression of Maximilian's
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P63"></a>63}</span>
visionary nature.  He actually entertained the
preposterous idea of himself succeeding Julius and
uniting Empire and Papacy in one person.  Lang,
Bishop of Gurk, was to proceed at once to Rome, to
persuade the Pope "to take us as coadjutor, so that
on his death we may be assured of having the
Papacy, and of becoming a priest, and afterwards a
saint, so that after my death you will be constrained
to adore me, whence I shall gain much glory."[<a id="chap03fn81text"></a><a href="#chap03fn81">81</a>]  If
necessary, Lang was to spend 300,000 ducats in
bribing the various Cardinals, and Maximilian counted
upon the assistance of Ferdinand and the people of
Rome.  His confidential letter to Margaret bears the
signature&mdash;"vostre bon père Maximilian, futur pape."
</p>

<p>
But these extravagant dreams were dissipated by
the unexpected recovery of Julius II., who plunged
more eagerly than ever into political life.  On
October 5, 1511, the Holy League was openly published
in Rome.  Its members&mdash;the Pope, Ferdinand and
Venice&mdash;veiled their real design, the expulsion of the
French, under the sanctimonious pretence of maintaining
the integrity of the Papal States.  Throughout
the early stages of the war Maximilian remained
virtually inactive, but steadily declined to desert his
French allies.  But none the less he permitted
Ferdinand and the Pope to conclude in his name a
ten months' truce with Venice.  He was thus in the
happy position of being in request with both sides,
while himself free from all immediate danger.  When
the death of Gaston de Foix at Ravenna (April 11,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P64"></a>64}</span>
1512) deprived the French of their most capable
leader, and the tide began to turn against them,
Maximilian inclined towards the side of the Pope.
In allowing 18,000 Swiss to pass through Tyrol on
their way to join the Venetians, and in issuing strict
orders that all Germans serving with Louis should
return home, he was certainly guilty of unfriendly
conduct towards his ally.  In the actual expulsion of
the French from the Milanese he took no direct part,
but from want of funds rather than disinclination,&mdash;the
Diet of Trier turning a deaf ear to his most
urgent entreaties.  At length in November he took
the decisive step.  Though he had hoped to see
Milan under his grandson Charles rather than
Massimiliano Sforza, he consented to a league with
Julius II., to whom the Imperial recognition of the
Lateran Council was of vital importance.  In return
for this the Pope promised his support against
Venice, with temporal as well as spiritual arms.

ARMOUR OF MAXIMILIAN
</p>

<p>
In February 1513, however, the situation was
again changed by the death of Julius II., and by the
reconciliation of France and Venice.  The new Pope,
Leo X., was vacillating and untrustworthy, though
nominally well-disposed to the Emperor; and the
latter began to turn elsewhere for an ally.  On April
5, 1513, a treaty of alliance was concluded between
Maximilian and Henry VIII., mainly through the
efforts of Margaret, who had long urged on her father
a break with France and a close union with Spain
and England.  At first we find him complaining that
Henry "gives us only to understand what he wishes
from us, while of what he ought to do for us there is
no mention."[<a id="chap03fn82text"></a><a href="#chap03fn82">82</a>]  But the promise of 100,000 gold
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P65"></a>65}</span>
crowns was magical in its effect; all his opposition
ceased, and he indulged in the usual sanguine
anticipations.  Ferdinand, Henry and Maximilian would
unite until France was completely crushed, and by a
joint invasion would win back all the territories which
had been wrested from their ancestors.  The alliance
was to be cemented at the earliest possible date by
the marriage of Charles to Mary of England.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding such threatening signs, the French
king pushed on his preparations for a new invasion of
Italy.  The rapid success of the expedition was
suddenly effaced on the field of Novara (June 6, 1513),
where the French sustained a severe defeat at the
hands of the Swiss and were driven back across the
Alps.  Their return to France virtually coincided with
the expedition of Henry VIII.  At the end of June
the English army landed at Calais, and marching
in three divisions, appeared before Thérouenne on
August 1.  Eleven days later he was joined by
Maximilian, who had already announced his intention of
serving as the English king's chief captain.  "His
experienced eye at once detected a capital blunder in
Henry's strategic position," but the lethargy and
exhaustion of the French had saved the latter from
any awkward consequences.  The French armies
had suffered terribly at Novara, and Louis XII. himself
was too broken in health to infuse vigour into
the operations.  On August 16, Maximilian, at the
head of the allied forces, won a brilliant little victory
at Guinegate, the scene of his earlier triumph over
the French in 1479.  The enemy's headlong retreat
won for the engagement the familiar name of the
Battle of Spurs.  This resulted in the surrender of
Thérouenne, whose example was followed on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P66"></a>66}</span>
September 24 by the important town of Tournai.  But,
in spite of Maximilian's eager encouragement, Henry
VIII. refused to make full use of his advantage.  The
lateness of the season, the difficulties of obtaining
sufficient supplies, and still more the position of
affairs in Scotland, made him anxious to return to
England; and in November he re-embarked his army,
leaving vague promises of a renewal of the campaign
in the following spring.  Maximilian's disappointment
had been seriously augmented by the course of events
on the Burgundian frontier.  Towards the end of
August an army of 30,000 Swiss and Germans, led
by Ulric of Würtemberg, had penetrated into
Burgundy, and on September 7 laid siege to Dijon.  A
determined assault upon the town came within an ace
of success, and made it clear to La Trémouille, the
commander of the garrison, that any prolonged resistance
was impossible.  Substantial bribes to the Swiss
leaders won over the invaders to a treaty, by which
Louis XII. was to make peace with the Pope, to
evacuate Milan, Cremona and Asti in favour of the
young Sforza, and to pay 400,000 crowns to the Swiss.
On the strength of this agreement Burgundy was
evacuated; but no sooner was all danger from that
quarter at an end than Louis XII. repudiated the
treaty, on the ground that La Trémouille had greatly
exceeded his powers.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the failure of Maximilian's hopes, he and
Henry seem to have parted on friendly terms.
Indeed, the last event of the campaign had been the
treaty of Lille (October 17, 1513), between the two
sovereigns and Ferdinand, which stipulated for a triple
attack on France in the summer.  Maximilian was
to maintain 10,000 troops on the French frontier in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P67"></a>67}</span>
return for a substantial subsidy from Henry VIII.,
and Charles's betrothal to Mary of England was
formally renewed.  But the unscrupulous Ferdinand
only signed this treaty to infringe it.  Ere six weeks
had elapsed, he had formed a close alliance with
Louis XII., which was to be cemented by the
marriage of the Princess Renée to one of Ferdinand's
grandsons.  Milan and Genoa were to form her
dowry, and were to be jointly occupied by the two
sovereigns until the marriage was actually accomplished.
Although the execution of this treaty could
not but thwart one at least of Maximilian's projects&mdash;the
marriage of Charles and Mary, and that of
young Ferdinand and Anne of Bohemia&mdash;-the
Emperor was none the less won over by the wiles of the
Catholic king to listen to French proposals of peace.
The earnest dissuasions and sagacious advice of
Margaret fell upon deaf ears.  "It seems to me," she
wrote, "that this is done only to amuse you ... in
order to gain time, just as happened last year by
reason of the truce....  Small wonder if Ferdinand is
the most readily disposed of you three towards peace;
for he has what he wants."[<a id="chap03fn83text"></a><a href="#chap03fn83">83</a>]  And again, "you know
the great inveterate hatred which the French bear
towards our House,"[<a id="chap03fn84text"></a><a href="#chap03fn84">84</a>] and, "it is clear that now is
the hour or never, when you will be able, with the aid
of your allies, to get the mastery over our common
enemies."  Even her warnings that peace means
that the Duchy of Burgundy will remain French[<a id="chap03fn85text"></a><a href="#chap03fn85">85</a>]
and that Henry VIII., "if he sees himself deserted
by you, will win for himself better terms than you
will know how to secure," seem to have been entirely
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P68"></a>68}</span>
disregarded by the obstinate Maximilian.  On March
13, 1514, the Emperor signed the treaty of Orleans
with France, and so confident was he of Ferdinand's
influence with his son-in-law Henry VIII., that he
actually guaranteed the English king's adhesion.
The natural result of such presumption was that
Henry and Maximilian fell apart, and early in August
the former made his own terms with Louis XII.,
fully justifying Margaret's prophecy that the French
King would set more value upon a settlement with
England than upon the less solid advantages to be
gained from her father's goodwill.
</p>

<p>
Peace was followed in October by the marriage of
the enfeebled Louis XII. and the vivacious Mary of
England, the rupture of whose betrothal to Charles
completed the estrangement of Henry and Maximilian.
But the gaieties and entertainments which
heralded the new Queen's arrival proved fatal to the
bridegroom.  The death of Louis XII. on New Year's
Day 1515, and the accession of his cousin, the young
and fiery Francis of Angoulême, produced a complete
change in the political situation.  The typical product
of his age, the new sovereign personified only too well
the France of the Renaissance and of the later Valois
kings, combining all their exaggerated license and
treachery with those debased ideals of chivalry which
had replaced the ancient code of honour.  His mind
was fired by wild dreams of foreign conquest, and his
accession was promptly followed by preparations for a
fresh invasion of Italy.  The treaties with England
and Venice were renewed, and by the end of March
the young Archduke Charles, who had assumed the
Government in January, signed, at the instance
of his tutor Chièvres, a treaty of peace and amity
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P69"></a>69}</span>
with France.  But the French monarch was not to
remain unopposed.  A new league was speedily
formed against him between the Pope, the Emperor,
Ferdinand, Milan and the Swiss, the latter resolutely
rejecting all Francis's overtures for peace.
Undeterred by the threatening attitude of the League,
Francis led a magnificent army of 60,000 men across
the Alps, and in the desperate battle of Marignano
(September 13 and 14, 1515) drove back the Swiss
army by sheer hard fighting.  Full 20,000 men were
left dead upon the field, and the Swiss, exhausted by
so crushing a defeat, were compelled to abandon the
Milanese to yet another conqueror.  Leo X. promptly
sued for peace, and the Spanish and Papal forces in
North Italy were practically disbanded.
</p>

<p>
The strange inactivity and want of interest, which
Maximilian would at first sight seem to have
displayed, while such grave issues were at stake, must
be attributed to an event of great importance in the
history of his own dominions.  This was no less than
his reception, at Vienna, of the Kings of Hungary
and Poland, which set a seal to the negotiations and
labours of many years by a final understanding
between the two dynasties.[<a id="chap03fn86text"></a><a href="#chap03fn86">86</a>]  Under the terms of the
Treaty of Vienna (July 22), Prince Louis of Hungary
was definitely betrothed to Mary of Austria,
while his sister Anne was delivered over to the
Emperor to be educated, in view of her marriage with
the young Archduke Ferdinand.  The flattery and
congratulations which surrounded these proceedings
included the adoption of Louis by Maximilian as his
successor in the Empire.  But this was merely a
formal move in the diplomatic game, calculated to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P70"></a>70}</span>
win the support of the young Prince.  The Emperor
well knew that the Electors cared little for any wishes
which he might express; otherwise we may be sure
that Charles, not Louis, would have been designated.[<a id="chap03fn87text"></a><a href="#chap03fn87">87</a>]
</p>

<p>
The completeness of Francis's success, and his
efforts to rouse the Scots against England drove
Henry VIII. into the arms of Ferdinand. (October
19.)  English gold was liberally expended among the
Confederates; and in February, 1516, 17,000 Swiss
mercenaries moved on Verona, to join the
Imperialists.  Maximilian, whose forces were further
swelled by levies of Tyrol and the Swabian League,
was thus enabled to take the offensive in North Italy,
with better prospects of success than on any previous
occasion.  In March he led a well-appointed army of
30,000 men across the Mincio, and forced the French
and Venetians to raise the siege of Brescia and fall
back upon their respective bases.  Maximilian
continued to advance rapidly beyond the Oglio and the
Adda, until he was within nine miles of Milan itself.
But now, when Bourbon was well-nigh incapable of
any prolonged resistance, and when fortune, after so
many rebuffs, seemed at length about to crown the
Imperial arms with victory, Maximilian, for some
inexplicable reason, hesitated to strike home, and
withdrew his army once more behind the Adda.  His
motives for so extraordinary a step have never been
discovered; and today we are as completely in the
dark as were his own allies at the time.  Pace, who,
as English envoy in Maximilian's camp, had peculiar
opportunities for clearing up the mystery, writes in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P71"></a>71}</span>
his report to Wolsey, "that no man could, ne can,
conject what thing moved him to be so slack at that time,
when every man did see the victory in his hands, and
the expulsion of the Frenchmen out of Italy."[<a id="chap03fn88text"></a><a href="#chap03fn88">88</a>]
Maximilian's own version&mdash;that the difficulties of foraging,
the enemy's superiority in cavalry, and the stoppage
of English money necessitated a retreat&mdash;is, in the
face of incontestable facts, most improbable; and the
only plausible suggestion&mdash;that the Emperor's change
of policy was produced by a liberal outlay of French
gold&mdash;is pure conjecture, unsupported by proofs.  If
we may believe the testimony of Pace in a matter
which concerned his own person (and there is no
reason to suspect his honesty), the Emperor, in his
straits for money, actually profited by the English
envoy's helpless condition, to extort a large sum of
money from him, declaring that in case of a refusal
he would make terms with France and would inform
Henry that Pace had been responsible for his
defection.[<a id="chap03fn89text"></a><a href="#chap03fn89">89</a>]
</p>

<p>
The universal indignation which Maximilian's
withdrawal aroused among the troops is shown by the
nicknames of "Strohkönig" and "Apfelkönig" which
were levelled at him.[<a id="chap03fn90text"></a><a href="#chap03fn90">90</a>]  The army rapidly melted
away, and, after struggling through the Val Camonica
in deep snow, he reached Innsbruck with but a few
hundred Tyrolese troops.  On May 26 Brescia
surrendered to the French and Venetians, and of all the
Emperor's conquests Verona alone continued its
resistance.
</p>

<p>
The sorry outcome of Maximilian's last Italian
expedition seriously impaired his credit, alike within the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P72"></a>72}</span>
Empire and abroad.  He now found it advisable to
give heed to the counsellors of his grandson Charles,
whose position had been materially altered by recent
events.  On January 23, 1516, the arch-intriguer
Ferdinand had passed from the scene of his
questionable triumphs; and the young Archduke was left
master of the entire Spanish dominions, with all their
boundless possibilities.  In spite of Francis' intrigues
in Gueldres and Navarre, and his scarcely veiled
designs upon the throne of Naples, Charles persisted
in a policy of friendship towards France.  On August
13 he concluded the Treaty of Noyon, by which
Francis was unquestionably the greater gainer.
Charles' betrothal to the French king's infant
daughter not only put in question his rights to Naples,
but also condemned him to remain a bachelor for
many years, until the bride should attain a marriageable
age.  He further undertook to win Maximilian's
consent to the restoration of Verona to the Republic,
for a sum of 200,000 ducats.
</p>

<p>
The Emperor at first repudiated an agreement
which implied such a lowering of self-esteem, and
again sought subsidies from Henry VIII.  But the
conclusion of the Perpetual Peace between Francis I. and
the Swiss (November 29, 1516) left him entirely
unsupported, and revealed to him the hopelessness of
further resistance.  By a treaty at Brussels,
Maximilian agreed to surrender Verona and to conclude a
six months' truce with the enemy.  But wounded
pride still kept him from consenting to a permanent
peace with Venice, and it was not till July 1518
that he finally acknowledged his discomfiture.  A
five years' truce was concluded, under the terms of
which Maximilian retained Roveredo and the district
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P73"></a>73}</span>
known as "the four Vicariates."[<a id="chap03fn91text"></a><a href="#chap03fn91">91</a>]  But these small
acquisitions were completely outbalanced by the
extensive pledging of domains, tolls and other sources
of revenues, which the long-drawn-out war had
rendered necessary, and by the further accumulation of
an enormous debt.  The dream of restoring Imperial
influence in Italy was thus finally and completely
dissolved.[<a id="chap03fn92text"></a><a href="#chap03fn92">92</a>]  While the French ruled supreme in the
North of Italy and the Spaniards in the South,
Germany alone saw herself excluded from the scenes of
her former predominance.  The blame of this failure
must rest largely with the Imperial Diet, which
hardly once throughout Maximilian's reign allowed
itself to be moved by considerations of patriotism, and
which by a studied neglect of the demands of foreign
policy clearly thwarted the true interests of Germany.
Yet, while there were several occasions on which
the effective assistance of the Estates would have
crowned the Imperial arms with success, it cannot be
denied that on the whole Maximilian displayed an
incapacity and want of decision which forms a striking
contrast to his earlier record.  The plain truth is
that Maximilian lacked the distinguishing features of
a great general, combining, if we may use a modern
comparison, the qualities of a drill-sergeant and a
cavalry-colonel.  Brave as a lion himself,[<a id="chap03fn93text"></a><a href="#chap03fn93">93</a>] he was
apt to forget the duties of a commander in the fierce
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P74"></a>74}</span>
delights of the melée; and the dashing successes of
his tactics were often neutralized by the want of a
connected plan for the whole campaign.  But we
cannot review his military failings without bestowing
the highest praise on his organizing and disciplinary
talents.  The landsknechts, who spread the fame of
the German arms throughout Europe, were mainly
his creation.  His eager care for their welfare, and
his readiness to share their fatigues and privations,
won him the entire devotion, nay adoration of his
soldiers; and a personal bond of union was thus
established between them, which accounts for their
willingness to submit to a continual discipline, such
as was still contrary to the practice of the age.
Among his many other accomplishments he possessed
a practical knowledge of the founder's trade,
which enabled him to invent several kinds of
siege- and field-pieces, and to introduce various minor
improvements in the art of war.
</p>

<p>
In the summer of 1518, while the settlement with
Venice was still pending, Maximilian met the Estates
of the Empire for the last time, at the Diet of
Augsburg.  His two main objects&mdash;the election of Charles
as his successor, and a permanent military organization
with a view to a crusade against the Turks,&mdash;met
with little encouragement from the Estates,
whose minds were filled with religious grievances
and dreams of a national German Church.  Hence
they were scarcely likely to assist the Emperor,
when they realized that his present policy involved
entire dependence upon the Pope.[<a id="chap03fn94text"></a><a href="#chap03fn94">94</a>]  The endless
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P75"></a>75}</span>
complaints and proposals which characterized the Diet,
"showed clearly that the highest power in the Empire
no longer fulfilled its office, but also that the
possibility of doing so had been removed from its hands."  But
Maximilian's comparative lifelessness at this time
admits of another explanation, apart from his
pre-occupation with the Venetian Treaty.  Throughout
the year he had been in failing health, and the
pathetic words in which he bade farewell to his
beloved Augsburg suggest that he was conscious of
his approaching end.  "God's blessing rest with thee,
dear Augsburg, and with all upright citizens of thine!
Many a happy mood have we enjoyed within thy
walls; now we shall never see thee more!"  Possibly
at the prompting of Cajetan, the Papal Legate,
Maximilian gave a most pointed proof of his lack of
sympathy with Luther, by leaving the city only two days
before the monk arrived.
</p>

<p>
The closing months of his life were troubled by
the uncertainty of the succession to the Empire.
His efforts to secure Charles' election as King of
the Romans had almost been crowned with success.
The day before he left Augsburg, he induced four of
the Electors to meet him and to give their consent
to the scheme.  But his hopes were dashed to the
ground by the opposition of Frederick of Saxony and
Richard von Greifenklau, Elector of Trier, who
contended that no election for the crown of the Romans
was possible, while Maximilian himself still remained
uncrowned as Emperor, and that Charles, as King
of Naples, was expressly debarred from the Imperial
dignity.  The cup of his disappointment was full, and
the Emperor retired wearily to Innsbruck, hoping to
end his days in peace beneath the shadow of his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P76"></a>76}</span>
beloved Alps.  But one final indignity awaited him.
The burghers of Innsbruck, who had suffered
severely on former occasions from the Emperor's
insolvency, resolutely closed their gates upon him;
and he was obliged to retire to Lower Austria.  On
January 12, 1519, Maximilian's adventurous career
closed at the little town of Wels, not far from Linz.
The body was interred without pomp in the Church
of St. George at Wiener Neustadt; but his heart was
removed to Bruges and buried beside the remains of
the consort, whose early loss had robbed him of
life's brightest joy.  Thus, amid disillusionment and
humiliation, ends the career which had opened so
full of rich promise.  With Maximilian passed away
the last Holy Roman Emperor, in the true mediaeval
sense.  The dominion of Charles V. was doubtless
more universal than any which Europe had seen
since the days of Charles the Great, but its
universality was essentially modern rather than
mediaeval&mdash;dynastic and personal, not founded on the old
dreams of an united Christian commonwealth.
"Henceforth the Holy Roman Empire is lost in the
German, and after a few faint attempts to resuscitate
old-fashioned claims nothing remains to indicate its
origin save a sounding title and a precedence among
the States of Europe."[<a id="chap03fn95text"></a><a href="#chap03fn95">95</a>]

<p class="intro">
"The essence of Humanism is the belief ... that
nothing which has ever interested living men and
women can wholly lose its vitality."&mdash;<i>Walter Pater</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It is with a certain sense of relief that we pass
from the tragi-comedy of Maximilian's political
life to those realms where lies his real claim to fame
and gratitude.  Great ambitions thwarted by the
sordid details of poverty are never a pleasant subject
of contemplation; and there have been few monarchs
in whose lives they have played a more prominent
part.  But it may fairly be argued that all the more
credit is due to one who, under such unfavourable
circumstances, ever remained buoyant and full of
the joy of living, and whose frequent disappointments
never soured his enthusiasms nor turned him from
the path of knowledge.  The first of his race to
welcome the new culture, and possessed of that
joyous temperament which seems to offer immortal
youth, Maximilian was acclaimed by the scholars
of his day as the ideal Emperor of Dante's or
Petrarch's dreams.  His predecessors had shown
little interest in intellectual pursuits.  Sigismund had
indeed crowned several poets, but was always too
needy himself to spare much money for their salaries;
Frederick III. was devoid of literary tastes, and,
in spite of his connexion with Æneas Sylvius, gave
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P78"></a>78}</span>
but slight encouragement to art or learning.  But
Maximilian surrendered himself, with all his habitual
energy and enthusiasm, to the new spirit of the age.
In spite of his many political failures he remains to
all time the darling of the scholar and the poet.  This
almost universal favour he did not win by liberal
donations or the grant of lucrative posts, for he was
seldom free from money embarrassments&mdash;nor by
the maintenance of a gorgeous court and imposing
ceremonial&mdash;for his endless projects and expeditions
made any fixed residence impossible; but by his
restless activity, his manly self-reliance, his wide and
human sympathy with all ranks and classes of the
people.  Above all, he identified himself with the
struggling ideals of a new German national feeling,
and with the growing opposition to France, to Italy,
and to Rome; and, as a national hero, inspired the
devotion alike of the scholar, the knight, and the
peasant.  "Mein Ehr ist deutsch Ehr, und deutsch
Ehr ist mein Ehr" is the ruling motive of his life;
and the praise which is continually on all lips is,
before all, the result of his passionate loyalty to that
larger Germany of which the poet sings&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So weit die deutsche Zunge klingt<br />

<p>
A vital distinction is at once apparent between
the Italian and the German Renaissance.  In Italy the
movement was essentially aristocratic and largely
dependent upon the various Courts&mdash;the Medici, the
Popes, the Dukes of Urbino.  In Germany such
open-handed patrons were few and far between.
Albert of Mainz, Frederick of Saxony, and Eberhard
of Würtemberg stand alone among the princes as
patrons of learning; while Ulrich von Hutten is the
sole representative of the Knightly order in the ranks
of the Humanists.[96a]  The political and intellectual
development of the German towns is of great
importance during this transition period, and it is in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P80"></a>80}</span>
them that the leaders of the German Renaissance are
to be found.  The movement remained throughout
municipal rather than aristocratic, making itself first
felt where there was closest commercial intercourse
with Italy&mdash;notably in the cities of Swabia and the
Rhine valley.  But for this very reason Humanism
took deep root in the soul of the German people.
Not merely aesthetic or sensuous, like the Italian
movement, it had a profound ethical and national
basis, on which the powerful art of Dürer, the
sonorous language of Luther, the sweet singing of
Hans Sachs, might safely rest.  Almost from the
very beginning it pursued a moral aim.  It was
inspired by no mere sordid quest of pleasure, but
by a noble dream of purer manners and loftier ideals.
It realized the decadence into which society, both lay
and ecclesiastical, had fallen, and earnestly strove to
arrest it in the only possible way&mdash;by the introduction
of a new spirit at once into the details of daily
life, and into the broad principles of national
existence.  But as the Humanist movement gathered
strength and influence, it remained isolated from
politics and from those who ruled the destinies of the
Empire, and, developing in various places and under
separate leaders, tended to waste its energies through
lack of systematic or united effort.  Under such
circumstances its unspoken appeal for assistance in
high places met with an eager response from Maximilian.
For the last twenty-five years of his life he
forms the central figure of the new movement&mdash;possibly
not its most glorious or most brilliant
representative, but yet giving life and uniformity to the
whole.  If for nought else, he would deserve to be
remembered as the connecting link between the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P81"></a>81}</span>
Humanists of Strasburg, Augsburg and Nuremberg.
In order to interpret this feature of the Emperor's
character, we must present a slight sketch of the
German Renaissance in its three main channels, with
especial regard to Maximilian and his connexion with
the leading Humanists, and must then proceed to
examine Maximilian's own literary achievements,
and his relations to Science and Art in its various
branches.
</p>

<p>
In a quaint old comedy written at the close of the
fifteenth century, Cicero and Caesar are brought to
life and taken round the cities of Germany.  They
are made to describe Strasburg as "the most beautiful
of the German towns, a treasure and ornament of
the Fatherland"; of Augsburg they exclaim, "Rome
with its Quirites has wandered here"; while Nuremberg
is pictured as "the Corinth of Germany, if one
looks at the wonderful works of the artist; yet if you
look at its walls and bastions, no Mummius would
conquer it so easily."[<a id="chap04fn97text"></a><a href="#chap04fn97">97</a>]  Such are the three great centres
of the German Renaissance.
</p>

<p>
In Strasburg, education was the most crying need
of the time; for though there were excellent schools
in the Franciscan and Dominican convents, these
were reserved for novices, the laity being wholly
excluded.  Jacob Wimpheling, under whom Humanism
first took deep root in the city, was himself a
pupil of the Deventer School,[<a id="chap04fn98text"></a><a href="#chap04fn98">98</a>] and, like them,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P82"></a>82}</span>
devoted his energies to educational reform.  His hopes
of founding a University were not realized, and he
had to content himself with forming the centre of a
literary society, such as was formed both at Mainz
and Vienna by Conrad Celtes.  Wimpheling and his
friends differ largely from their contemporaries in
other parts of Germany.  They were characterized
by a theological bias which led them into violent and
unprofitable controversies.  Though himself a cleric,
and thus a supporter of the spiritual order and of
orthodox belief, he indulged in fierce attacks upon the
monks for their immorality, and in spite of his
admiration for heathen authors, he pushed his defence of
theology so far as to condemn the Art of Poetry as
useless and unworthy to be called a science, and only
to exempt from utter damnation the sacred poets of
Christianity.[<a id="chap04fn99text"></a><a href="#chap04fn99">99</a>]  He was equally limited in his patriotic
polemics.  His praise of everything German is only
surpassed by his hatred for the French and Italians,
his profound contempt for the Swiss.  His best-known
work, entitled <i>Germania</i>, was written with the double
object of proving the exclusively German origin of
Alsace and of "defending the King of the Romans
against the monks and secular preachers who attack
him."[<a id="chap04fn100text"></a><a href="#chap04fn100">100</a>]  Even the ingenuous arguments in which
the book abounds, and the quaint array of authorities,
from Caesar and Tacitus to Aeneas Sylvius and Sabellico
cannot blind us to the genuine patriotism, which
is latent in every page.  "We are Germans, not
French," he exclaims, "and our land must be called
Germany, not France, because Germans live in it.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P83"></a>83}</span>
This fact has been acknowledged by the Romans.
For when they had conquered us, the Alemanni
on the Rhine, and, crossing the river, saw that
the dwellers on the further bank were like us in
courage, stature, and fair hair, as well as in
customs and way of life, they called us Germans,
that is, brothers.  But it is certain that we, these
Germans, are like the real Gauls neither in speech
and appearance, nor in character and institutions.
Hence our city and all Alsace is right in
preserving the freedom of the Roman Empire, and
will maintain it also in the future, in spite of all
French attempts to win over or conquer us."[<a id="chap04fn101text"></a><a href="#chap04fn101">101</a>]  Such
fervent expressions of German feeling must have called
Maximilian's attention to Wimpheling, even without
his vigorous defence of the Imperial dignity.  In 1510,
when Maximilian was opposed to Julius II., and
hoped to intimidate him by recounting the wrongs of
the German nation, he could think of none more
versed in them than Wimpheling, and therefore
requested him to draw up a summary of the French
Pragmatic Sanction, such as would suit the needs of
Germany.  In March, 1511, he wrote to Wimpheling
that he was about to hold an assembly at Koln, to
deliberate with the French envoys as to summoning
a general Council; and he begged him to think out
means of redressing the various abuses, "without
touching religion."  As a result of this request,
Wimpheling drew up his <i>Gravamina Germanicae
Nationis</i> and added the desired <i>Remedia</i>.[<a id="chap04fn102text"></a><a href="#chap04fn102">102</a>]  But
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P84"></a>84}</span>
the Emperor's policy had already changed, and
Wimpheling was informed through the Imperial
Councillors that the moment was unfavourable for
publication.  Indeed, his labours only received the
attention which they deserved, when they were
employed as the basis of "The Hundred Grievances
of the German Nation" (1522).[<a id="chap04fn103text"></a><a href="#chap04fn103">103</a>]
</p>

<br />
SEBASTIAN BRANT
</p>

<p>
Side by side with Wimpheling stands Sebastian
Brant, whose literary worth has probably obtained
wider recognition than that of any German Humanist,
with the sole exception of Erasmus.  His <i>Narrenschiff</i>
("The Ship of Fools") is penetrated by a deep
religious spirit, and fearlessly attacks all the
corruptions and abuses of the day, "branding as fools all
those who are willing, for things transitory, to barter
things eternal."[<a id="chap04fn104text"></a><a href="#chap04fn104">104</a>]  Brant is in no sense a great poet;
his verses are often stiff and ill-proportioned, and his
matter frequently sinks to the level of the common-place.
But the appearance of "The Ship of Fools"
caused an unparalleled stir, not merely in the republic
of letters, but throughout the whole German people;
and it owes its extraordinary popularity to its skilful
intermixture of problems which were in all men's
minds.  He was the first to give full expression to the
ideas of the middle classes (anticipating the manly
independence of the Scottish poet,[<a id="chap04fn105text"></a><a href="#chap04fn105">105</a>]) when he
sang&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P85"></a>85}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Aber wer hätt' kein Tugend nit,<br />
  Kein Zucht, Scham, Ehr, noch gute Sitt,<br />
  Den halt' ich alles Adels leer,<br />
  Wenn auch ein Fürst sein Vater wär'.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
But the ruling motives which inspire his muse are the
maintenance of the Church in her pristine purity, and
the defence of Christendom against the onslaught of
the infidel.  While he preaches earnestly the
Headship of Christ, and exhorts all men to put their trust
in God rather than in mortal men, he is also never
tired of enjoining reverence for the Emperor, and
urging them to unite in loyal obedience to his wishes
and aspirations.  Apparently unconscious of his
inconsequence, he upheld the principle of absolute
Papal domination, and yet early associated himself
with that august dream of the Middle Ages&mdash;the
universal monarchy of the Emperor.  For him he
claimed the same power in the temporal, as the Pope
exercised in the spiritual world.  As the Pope was
the organ of religion, so was the Emperor the source of
Law; and the revival of his power as temporal head
of Christendom was to coincide with the re-establishment
of that order and discipline whose absence
Brant so frequently laments.  The whole fabric of
these vast aspirations Brant rested upon Maximilian.
He could not foresee that this prince, so brilliant, so
chivalrous, so sympathetic, would disappoint the rich
promise of his youth and fail to restore the fallen
grandeur of the Empire owing to his schemes of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P86"></a>86}</span>
family aggrandisement.  He greeted his election with
adulatory verses, protesting that under such a prince
the Golden Age could not fail to return.  The news of
Maximilian's imprisonment at Bruges rouses a very
whirlwind of indignant phrases, contrary to the whole
spirit of his later teaching.  "Destroy the Flemings,"
he cries, "extirpate the very race of this crime, hang
and behead the miscreants, overturn their walls, and
make the plough pass over this accursed soil.  Such is
the demand of justice."[<a id="chap04fn106text"></a><a href="#chap04fn106">106</a>]  His belief in omens and
portents is unlimited, and they are generally
connected with Maximilian in some quaint and
high-sounding verses.  Thus the killing of an enormous
deer on some hunting expedition inspires Brant with
an absurd and laboured comparison.  "No animal is
nobler than the stag: thou, Maximilian, art the
most noble of Princes.  He stops astonished before
things which seem new; thou also dost admire things
new and great.  At the approach of danger he pricks
up his ear and places his young in safety; thou
hearest the menacing noises of thine enemies, and dost
protect thy people."[<a id="chap04fn107text"></a><a href="#chap04fn107">107</a>]  A number of falcons which
were seen to assemble and fly southwards is acclaimed
as a symbol of Maximilian, aided by the Princes in his
Italian expedition.  "Destiny calls you, O Germans;
go and restore the Empire in Italy."  Even when it
became evident that Maximilian was not destined to
realize the poet's high ideals, such extravagances did
not cease.  Moreover, he was sustained by a personal
attachment for the Emperor, which was deepened by
his various visits to the Court and closer acquaintance
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P87"></a>87}</span>
with his early hero, and doubtless strengthened by the
Imperial favours bestowed upon him.  And thus it is
with unfeigned grief that Brant celebrates his death.
"O magnanimous Caesar, that hope is vanished
which we had founded on thee while thou didst hold
the sceptre.  How should I restrain my tears?
Thou wert worthy to live, thou the sole anchor of
safety for the German nation.  One swift hour hath
removed thee: thou art no more, and misfortune
assails the Empire."[<a id="chap04fn108text"></a><a href="#chap04fn108">108</a>]  Our subject is Maximilian, not
Brant, and we may not linger.  But the epitaph on
the Strasburg poet's tomb should not be omitted, even
in the translation; for it gives us a sure clue to a
character which was sweet and winning in spite of all
its extravagances.  "Toi qui regardes ce marbre,
souhaite à Brant le ciel!"

If in Strasburg the movement assumed a theological
and educational character, in Augsburg it was
rather directed towards politics and the study of
history.  Alike from its geographical position[<a id="chap04fn109text"></a><a href="#chap04fn109">109</a>] and
from its industrial and commercial importance,[<a id="chap04fn110text"></a><a href="#chap04fn110">110</a>]
Augsburg was thrown into close relations with Italy and
Italian thought; and enthusiasm for classical studies
was early introduced by Sigismund Gossembrot, one
of the leading merchants of the city.  The direction
of the movement was further influenced by the Diets
which were held within the city,[<a id="chap04fn111text"></a><a href="#chap04fn111">111</a>] and by the frequent
visits of the Emperor Maximilian.[<a id="chap04fn112text"></a><a href="#chap04fn112">112</a>]  The place of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P88"></a>88}</span>
Gossembrot was worthily filled by Conrad Peutinger,[<a id="chap04fn113text"></a><a href="#chap04fn113">113</a>]
who returned from Italy in 1485, as a doctor of law,
embued with all the ardour of a scholar.  He became
a prominent official of his native city, and retained his
position for many years from inclination rather than
from necessity, betraying throughout his writings the
sharp eye and critical knowledge of the practitioner.
His first meeting with Maximilian probably took place
at Augsburg in 1491, and from this time onwards he
was continually employed by the Emperor in various
positions of trust.  As ambassador, secretary or
orator, he visited many countries in Europe, and,
besides ordering affairs of politics, was entrusted with
the truly humanist task of presenting and answering
formal addresses and greetings.  While in his foreign
relations he was eager to maintain the honour of the
German name, he skilfully used his double position
as Imperial Councillor and Town-official to smooth
over differences between Maximilian and Augsburg,
to the advantage of both parties.  The Emperor's
love of Augsburg led him to purchase various houses
within the walls, and the castle of Wellenburg in the
neighbourhood.  His action was far from welcome to
the burghers, who did not wish this powerful citizen
to acquire too much property in their midst; and they
were only pacified by the assurances of Peutinger
that Maximilian would raise no fortifications round
the castle.  On the other hand, during his honourable
mission to Hungary (1506), he obtained from the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P89"></a>89}</span>
Emperor a substantial grant of privileges for his
native city&mdash;notably the right "de non appellando."  But
Peutinger was Maximilian's confidant not merely
in political affairs.  Indeed, his employment in
Imperial diplomacy directly arose from his intellectual
and artistic relations with Maximilian, who sought the
support of every scholar in his attempt to place the
Fatherland in the forefront of Art and Science.  In
Italy Peutinger had learned the value of old Roman
inscriptions, and in 1505 he was encouraged by
Maximilian to publish a collection of the inscriptions of
German antiquity.[<a id="chap04fn114text"></a><a href="#chap04fn114">114</a>]  The Emperor and the scholar
kept up a correspondence on the subject of ancient
coins, large consignments of which were sent to
Augsburg, by order of the former, from every part of
the Empire.  During Peutinger's visit to Vienna in
1506 he was monopolized for three whole days for
learned conversation, and received a new and more
important commission from Maximilian.  He was to
examine the letters and documents of members of the
House of Hapsburg, and to prepare a selection of
them for publication; and with this object he was
assigned a special apartment in the castle of Vienna,
to which chronicles and histories were brought for
his use from all quarters.  Here he remained for
almost three months, and the fruit of his labours was
the <i>Kaiserbuch</i>, or Book of the Emperors, which was
unfortunately never published and which is now
extant only in a few fragments.  During his labours
for Maximilian he seems to have acquired a great
number of valuable manuscripts; and had his literary
projects been fully realized, we should have gained
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P90"></a>90}</span>
an astonishing contribution to the historiography of
the sixteenth century.  But apart from his own
unfinished writings, he edited and published, with
Maximilian's approval, various early historical works,&mdash;the
chronicles of Paul the Deacon and of Ursperg being
of especial value.[<a id="chap04fn115text"></a><a href="#chap04fn115">115</a>]  Moreover, he was charged by the
Emperor with a species of censorship, by virtue of
which he prevented the appearance at Augsburg of a
Swiss Chronicle, containing statements derogatory to
the House of Hapsburg.  In short, in almost every
phase of the struggle of culture and civilization, which
Maximilian so gallantly led, we find Peutinger
intimately engaged as his friend and fellow-labourer; and
with Beatus Rhenanus we may truly exclaim,
"Our Conrad Peutinger is the immortal ornament,
not merely of the town of Augsburg, but also of all
Swabia!"
</p>

<p>
The activity of Augsburg was not confined to
historical studies.  The rising art of Germany had
found here a worthy representative in Hans Holbein,
who, though not strictly a Humanist himself, took the
deepest interest in the movement.  His attitude is
clearly visible from his portraiture of Erasmus, More,
and other leaders of the Renaissance, and from his
illustrations to the <i>Praise of Folly</i> and the <i>Dance of
Death</i>.  But Holbein, though the greatest of the
Augsburg School, was too much of a wanderer to be
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P91"></a>91}</span>
thrown into close contact with Maximilian.  The
latter none the less found capable artists to give
expression to his own literary projects.  Hans
Burgkmair, the most distinguished of their number,
produced over one hundred illustrations of <i>Weisskunig</i>,
seventy-seven for the <i>Genealogy</i>, which consists of
portraits of Maximilian's ancestors, and close upon
seventy for the <i>Triumphal Procession</i>, the main idea of
which belongs to Dürer.  Leonhard Beck illustrated
a book of <i>Austrian Saints</i>, and the greater part of the
famous <i>Teuerdank</i>; whilst Freydal represented in his
<i>Mummereien</i> the various tournays and festivities of
which Maximilian was the central figure.  All these
woodcuts and engravings were executed under the
supervision of Peutinger, who also directed the
casting of figures for Maximilian's tomb at Innsbruck,
and the making of armour and warlike equipments
for the Emperor's own person.  Indeed, Maximilian
put his Humanist friend to very strange uses; for
among the manifold commissions of Peutinger we
find the selection of tapestries from the Netherlands,
inquiries after the inventor of a special kind of
siege-ladder, the building of hatching-houses for the
Imperial falcons, and the establishment of an important
cannon foundry.  The climax is reached when
Maximilian employs Peutinger's historical knowledge to
obtain the names of a hundred women famous in
history, after whom he may christen the latest additions
to his artillery!

Of the three centres of German Humanism,
Nuremberg is the greatest and the most fascinating.
The home of invention as well as of industry, it
made no mere empty boast in the proverb, "Nürnberg
Tand geht durch alle Land."  Its churches and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P92"></a>92}</span>
public buildings were the glory of the age, its
craftsmen and designers perhaps then unequalled in the
world.  Its literary circle contains a larger
number of distinguished names than any of its rivals.
Meisterlin, the author of the famous Nuremberg
chronicle, Cochläus, the bitter satirist of Luther;
Osiander, the celebrated Hebrew scholar and
Reformed preacher; Jäger the mathematician; above all
Hans Sachs, the cobbler-poet, "the sweet singer of
Nuremberg"&mdash;all these fill an honourable place in
the annals of the city.  But the central figures of its
life are, beyond any doubt, Wilibald Pirkheimer and
Albrecht Dürer; in any case they would monopolise
our attention on account of their intimate connexion
with Maximilian.  When still King of the Romans,
he had resided at Nuremberg, and the joyous
animation with which he entered into the life of the city
won for him wide popularity.  "When about to
depart, we are told he invited twenty great ladies to
dinner; after dinner, when they were all in a good
humour, the Markgrave Frederick asked Maximilian
in the name of the ladies to stay a little longer and to
dance with them.  They had taken away his boots
and spurs, so that he had no choice.  Then the whole
company adjourned to the Council House, several
other young ladies were invited, and Maximilian
stayed dancing all through the afternoon and night,
and arrived a day late at Neumarkt, where the Count
Palatine had been expecting him all the preceding
day."[<a id="chap04fn116text"></a><a href="#chap04fn116">116</a>]  As Emperor, Maximilian paid many visits to
Nuremberg, and his first Diet was enlivened by a
succession of brilliant masques, dances and
tournaments, such as roused the enthusiasm of the local
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P93"></a>93}</span>
chroniclers.  He remained on terms of great
intimacy with Pirkheimer, who in many ways is the
most typical figure of the German Renaissance.
After an excellent education, at Padua and Pavia, in
jurisprudence, literature and arts, Pirkheimer became
councillor in Nuremberg, and won the special
confidence of the Emperor both by his skilful diplomacy
and by his patriotic assistance in the Swiss War.
His great riches he employed not merely for the
adornment of his own house, but also in generous
support of less-favoured followers of the Muse.
While he resembled Peutinger as diplomat, as
historian, and as theologian, he had less of the
temperament of a pedagogue, and more of the joyous nature
of a true poet.  As the representative of a great
movement of the intellect, he was open to all its
various methods and aspirations, and yet understood
the lesson of self-restraint and concentration too well
to exhaust his powers in a labyrinth of alternatives.
With the true cheerfulness and humour of the man
who knows the world, yet remains unsullied by contact
with it, he and his friends devoted themselves to
what is after all the highest philosophy, the study of
mankind&mdash;hiding under a smiling face, nay, often a
mocking mien, their confidence in the great
destinies of the race.  And yet a deep pathos attaches
to Pirkheimer's closing days.  Disappointed in his
dreams of moral and spiritual regeneration for the
people, he turned wearily back from the paths of the
new doctrine to the bosom of Mother Church.  His
violent attack upon Johann Eck, his noble defence of
Reuchlin, had seemed to foreshadow him as a leader
of the Reformation.[<a id="chap04fn117text"></a><a href="#chap04fn117">117</a>]  But his ideals were in reality of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P94"></a>94}</span>
the past rather than of the future; and, brooding
over his shattered hopes, he lingered out a solitary
old age, whose sadness is but deepened by his
swan-like lament for Dürer.

Dürer was indeed well worthy of all the praise
which has been lavished upon him; for from all his
works there shines forth the noble modesty of a pure
good man.  Though scarcely a scholar himself, his
deep sympathy with the great movement is manifest
not only in the manner in which his art interprets it,
but also in his own written words.[<a id="chap04fn118text"></a><a href="#chap04fn118">118</a>]  His letters to
Pirkheimer from Venice form delightful reading and
show the keenness of his sympathy and observation.
The years which followed his return to Nuremberg,
1507-1514, were the most productive period of his
life, as well as the period of his most intimate
connexion with Maximilian.  From them date the
ambitious designs of the "Ehrenpforte" (Triumphal
Arch), which, though executed under Maximilian's
direct supervision, were entirely the idea of Dürer.
No less than ninety-two large woodcuts, the
production of which occupied Dürer for two years, go to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P95"></a>95}</span>
make up this imposing metaphorical picture.  A
structure in itself impossible is overburdened by
portraits of all the ancestors of Maximilian, mythical
as well as real, and by the many exploits and
adventures of the Emperor's own life.  But the work must
be estimated less by the quaintness of its composition
than by its sterling artistic qualities and by the
important place which it holds in the development of
German Art.  The idea was further developed in
the "Triumphzug" and the "Triumphwagen,"
which was completed in 1516.  The Imperial and
other triumphal cars were drawn by Dürer in
sixty-three woodcuts, while the remaining seventy-four
were prepared in Augsburg by Hans Burgkmair and
L. Beck.[<a id="chap04fn119text"></a><a href="#chap04fn119">119</a>]  The procession, whose magnificence was
to idealize Maximilian as the greatest of Princes,
includes sketches of almost everything that ever
roused the Emperor's interest.  Landsknechts,
cannon, huntsmen, mummers, dancers of every
rank and variety, the noble ladies of the Court, are
mingled with allegories of every Imperial and human
virtue, elaborately grouped upon triumphal cars.
The keen personal interest of Maximilian in the
progress of the work is well attested.  Indeed, he
showed his impatience, while the various blocks were
in progress, by frequently visiting not merely Dürer
himself, but also the "formschneider" or block-cutter,
who lived in a street approached by the
Frauengasslein.  Hence the old Nuremberg proverb,
"The Emperor still often drives to Petticoat Lane."[<a id="chap04fn120text"></a><a href="#chap04fn120">120</a>]
Dürer was appointed painter to Maximilian, with a
grant of arms and a salary of 100 florins a year; and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P96"></a>96}</span>
a letter of the Emperor to the Town Council of
Nuremberg is still extant, in which he demands
Dürer's exemption from "communal imposts, and
all other contributions in money, in testimony of
our friendship for him, and for the sake of the
marvellous art of which it is but just that he should
freely benefit.  We trust that you will not refuse the
demand we now make of you, because it is proper,
as far as possible, to encourage the arts he
cultivates and so largely develops among you."[<a id="chap04fn121text"></a><a href="#chap04fn121">121</a>]  These
earnest words of Maximilian reveal to us very clearly
his attitude towards the great movement of his day.
Yet, sad as it is to relate, Dürer never received
payment for the ninety-two sheets of the "Triumphal
Arch," which had cost him so much time and labour,
and after Maximilian's death they were sold separately.
But the Emperor may fairly be absolved from
the charge of mean treatment of Dürer, for his own
needs were great and many, and it is strictly true
that he spent very little upon himself.  The great
artist was always treated with distinction as a
personal friend of the Emperor, who, besides granting
him a fixed salary, gave him material assistance in
checking the forging and pirating of his engravings.
He sometimes resided at Court, when Maximilian
held it at Augsburg, and often employed his time in
making sketches in chalk of the illustrious persons
whom he met.  On one occasion Maximilian was
attempting to draw a design for Dürer, but kept
breaking the charcoal in doing so.  When the artist
took the pencil and, without once breaking it, easily
completed the sketch, the Emperor expressed his
surprise and probably showed his annoyance.  But
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P97"></a>97}</span>
Dürer was ready with his compliment.  "I should
not like your Majesty," he said, "to be able to draw
as well as I.  It is my province to draw and yours to
rule."[<a id="chap04fn122text"></a><a href="#chap04fn122">122</a>]  Not the least interesting and important of
Dürer's commissions was to paint that portrait of the
Emperor which now hangs in the Imperial Gallery at
Vienna.  The prominent nose, the hanging eyelid, the
half-contemptuous, half-mournful turn of the lips, the
wrinkled cheeks and neck, the long hair falling over
the ears, the pointed bonnet with its clasp, the sombre
flowing robes, form a striking picture and suggest a
speaking likeness.  Disappointment, but also that
peculiar attribute of the Hapsburgs, resignation, are clearly
marked upon Maximilian's face.  In the other two
portraits by Dürer&mdash;a chalk drawing executed at the
Diet of Augsburg (1518) and a woodcut completed
shortly before his death&mdash;the features are less rugged,
and reveal somewhat more of the sanguine spirit of
Maximilian's early days.  With the exception of
these sketches,[<a id="chap04fn123text"></a><a href="#chap04fn123">123</a>] Dürer's last commission for
Maximilian was the exquisite decoration for the latter's
private Gebetbuch (Book of Prayer), of which only
ten copies were printed,[<a id="chap04fn124text"></a><a href="#chap04fn124">124</a>] and which will ever remain
one of the gems of artistic and devotional literature.
With Dürer's career after 1519 we are not concerned;
but it is worthy of notice that his most brilliant work
dates from the reign of Maximilian, and that his
sympathy with "the nightingale of Wittenberg" seems
to have partially diverted his attention from his art.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P98"></a>98}</span>
</p>

<p>
It must not be supposed that Maximilian's humanistic
enthusiasms were confined to the three great
centres which have just been described, or that he
only helped on such movements as were already
animated by a vigorous existence and a fair prospect
of success.  His own hereditary dominions were
even more directly indebted to his efforts than were
other parts of the Empire.

</p>

<p>
During the first century of its existence, Vienna
University[<a id="chap04fn125text"></a><a href="#chap04fn125">125</a>] was an autonomous ecclesiastical
corporation, over which the methods of the mediaeval
Schoolmen held complete sway.  But during the long
reign of Frederick III., several circumstances
combined to cast a blight upon its hitherto flourishing
condition.  During the Council of Basel it assumed a
hostile attitude to the Pope, and its surrender of that
position only emphasised its folly; while in the
struggle of Frederick and his brother Albert the
professors were unwise enough to dabble in politics
and thus to throw off the immunity which guarded
their proper sphere.  Their open sympathy with
Albert was fatal to a good understanding with
Frederick, who never showed any favour to their
body.  Vienna further suffered from a six months'
siege by Matthias of Hungary (1477) and from a
violent outbreak of the plague (1481); and this had
scarce abated, when war was renewed and Matthias
overran the whole of Lower Austria.  During the
ensuing siege (December 1484 to June 1485) all lectures
were inevitably suspended, and the whole work of
the University was at a standstill.  The refusal of
the University authorities to take the oath of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P99"></a>99}</span>
allegiance to Matthias&mdash;on the ground that, as a clerical
corporation, they were independent of the temporal
power&mdash;induced the conqueror to stop all the
revenues which they derived from the government;
and though he at length granted[<a id="chap04fn126text"></a><a href="#chap04fn126">126</a>] a sum sufficient for
the payment of the Professors and other necessities,
yet he never extended to Vienna the same liberality
towards Art and Science which had distinguished his
relations with Buda-Pest.  By the time of his death
(1490) Vienna University was in a state of almost
complete decay.
</p>

<p>
Under such circumstances the recovery of Austria
by Maximilian was greeted with joy on the part of
the authorities, and immediate steps were taken to
restore the tottering fabric of the University.
Maximilian set himself definitely to transform it from a
clerical corporation to a home of the new Humanism,
and was aided in this difficult task by the Superintendent
Perger, the intention of whose office was not
only to control the Government grants, but also to
decide upon their expenditure, and to refer to the
Emperor all questions of professorial appointments.
In spite of much internal opposition, the Humanists
ere long acquired predominance in the philosophical
Faculty, the medicals threw off the monstrous requirements
of Scholasticism, and the jurists began to study
Roman as well as ecclesiastical law.  The revival
of Vienna soon roused the interest of that peculiar
product of the Renaissance period, the wandering
scholar.  The first to visit the University was Johann
Spiesshaimer&mdash;more celebrated as Cuspinian&mdash;who
rapidly won favour with the Hapsburgs by a poem
in praise of St. Leopold, Markgrave of Austria, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P100"></a>100}</span>
who was crowned poet by Maximilian shortly after his
father's death, in presence of a brilliant and
representative assembly.  Soon afterwards he began to hold
regular lectures on poetry and rhetoric, discussing
such writers as Cicero, Sallust, Horace, Virgil and
Lucan.  But Perger's preference lay decidedly with
the Humanists of Italy, many of whom he had known
personally during his residence at Padua and Bologna.
At his recommendation, Maximilian in 1493
summoned Hieronymus Balbus from Venice to Vienna,
and appointed him lecturer on the Roman Poets.
But the Italian's fiery temper soon led him into
disputes with the University authorities, and after an
unsatisfactory career of two years he found a fresh
outbreak of plague in the city a convenient pretext for
returning to Italy.  Krachenberger and Fuchsmagen,
the two councillors whom Maximilian had appointed
to assist Perger, doubtless influenced by the unseemly
brawling of Balbus, were loud in their complaints
of Perger's favouritism, and urged their Imperial
master to encourage German rather than Italian
scholars.  But Maximilian was, after all, only
following his own judgment, when in 1497 he sent a cordial
invitation to Stabius and Celtes to fill professorships
at Vienna.
</p>

<p>
Conrad Celtes is the most famous of the earlier
German Humanists, and is in a sense the forerunner
of Peutinger and Pirkheimer.  But while his
influence penetrated into every part of the Empire
as a stimulating force, Vienna was the scene of his
longest and most definite labours, and hence all
mention of him has been postponed till now.  Born in
1459, in humble circumstances, Celtes devoted himself
from youth to the pursuit of learning, studying the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P101"></a>101}</span>
Roman classics in the leading universities of Germany.
Without any settled abode, he wandered from one
university to another, associating with scholars and
supporting himself by lectures on the philosophy of
Plato, the rhetoric of Cicero, or the poetry of Horace.
In 1486 he visited Italy and made the acquaintance
of all the famous Humanists of the age.  On his
return, the publication of his first treatise, the <i>Ars
Versificandi</i>, brought him to the notice of Frederick III.,
by whom he was crowned as poet at the Diet of
Nuremberg (1487).  During the next four years he
visited Cracow, Prague, Buda, Heidelberg and Mainz,
and again settled down at Nuremberg in 1491.  Here
he published a life of St. Sebald, patron of the city, in
sapphics, and a treatise upon the origin and customs
of Nuremberg itself.  But within a year he was
summoned to Ingolstadt as Professor of Poetry
and Rhetoric, and here he was residing when
Maximilian's letter reached him.  The Emperor's appeal
was not in vain, and Celtes took up his permanent
abode in Vienna University in 1497, as professor of
the same subjects as at Ingolstadt.  His opening
lectures, which treated the philosophy of Plato in
connexion with the Neo-Platonism of the Italian
scholars, were regarded with suspicion and dislike
by many members of the University; but his
position was strengthened by the hearty support of
Maximilian, who in 1501 appointed Cuspinian, the
intimate friend of Celtes, to the post of
Superintendent.  Celtes, and with him the Emperor, was
convinced that new methods of instruction were
necessary, if Humanism was to triumph over
Scholasticism.  "A new institute was required,
which should serve for the preparation and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P102"></a>102}</span>
training of Humanism, a sort of seminary of Humanist
scholars, not outside, but <i>inside</i>, the University."[<a id="chap04fn127text"></a><a href="#chap04fn127">127</a>]  These
views led, in October 1501, to the foundation
of the "Collegium Poetarum et Mathematicorum"
by Maximilian.  Planned by Celtes with the active
approval of Cuspinian, the College in no way formed
a fifth Faculty, though it was directly connected with
the Faculty of Arts.  Of its two divisions, the first
was devoted to the study of mathematics, physics
and astronomy, the second to that of poetry and
rhetoric.  The right of the coronation of poets, which
had hitherto lain with the Emperor alone, was now
vested by Maximilian in Celtes, as director of his own
creation.  The most distinguished scholars were to
receive the crown of laurel, as a mark of high distinction
and as an incentive to further efforts.  But this
privilege was exercised by Celtes for the first and last
time, when in 1502 he crowned Stabius, his former
colleague at Ingolstadt, and now Professor of
Mathematics and Astronomy at Vienna.  All subsequent
coronations of poets were by Maximilian himself;[<a id="chap04fn128text"></a><a href="#chap04fn128">128</a>]
and the College of Poets fell into disuse after the
death of Celtes in 1508.  Even had worthy successors
to Celtes and Stabius been found, it is doubtful
whether the College would have had a permanent
existence.  Its hybrid position, as an independent
institution and yet an integral part of the University,
was a source of endless bickerings and quarrels,
which can scarcely have been a recommendation to
foreign scholars.  Celtes' other peculiar institution,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P103"></a>103}</span>
the "Literary Society of the Danube," which he had
originally founded at Buda, and which transplanted
itself to Vienna when he settled there, was a kind of
academy or free union of scholars for the spread of
Humanism.  Its members were recruited from almost
every nation, and were only held together by the
personal influence of Celtes; on his death it shared
the same fate as the College of Poets.
</p>

<br />
CONRAD CELTES.
</p>

<p>
An interesting development of such Humanist unions
formed itself in the mind of Aldus Manutius, the
famous Venetian printer.  He longed for the establishment
of an academy which should devote itself to the
perfecting of printing and to the spread of the Greek
language, and he entertained the further hope of
converting it into an educational institute, which should
form a point of scientific intercourse between Germany
and Italy, under the direct initiative of the Emperor.
But though he approached Maximilian on the subject,
he obtained nothing but vague promises of assistance,
whose fulfilment was thwarted by the Emperor's lack
of resources.
</p>

<p>
Besides his general services to Humanism, Celtes
earned the gratitude of Maximilian by his attention to
historical studies.  His sketch of Nuremberg contains
a valuable description of its buildings and its trades,
its climate and its inhabitants.  His eager investigations
resulted in the discovery of the comedies of the
Saxon nun Hroswith, whose lax morality has been
adduced as a proof of their fictitious character, and
the works of Ligurinus, upon which he and his friends
lectured at Vienna.[<a id="chap04fn129text"></a><a href="#chap04fn129">129</a>]  At the moment of his death he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P104"></a>104}</span>
was engaged upon important work for Maximilian.
His projected history of the origin of the House of
Hapsburg still remained very much in embryo; but
his great work, <i>Germania Illustrata</i>, had assumed
very real dimensions and would, if completed, have
eclipsed even the famous <i>Nuremberg Chronicle</i>.
</p>

<p>
The place of Celtes was filled in Maximilian's
estimation by Stabius and Cuspinian.  The former,
who had been crowned poet in 1502, was appointed
Historiographer by the Emperor in 1508, and was
virtually monopolized for historical research.  Even
during Maximilian's last illness Stabius was employed
to read aloud volumes of Austrian history.[<a id="chap04fn130text"></a><a href="#chap04fn130">130</a>]  But his
achievements in the field of history are of trifling
value, and are not to be compared to his works on
geographical and mathematical subjects.  Cuspinian is
much more worthy of consideration, especially as
his relations with Maximilian drew him in the same
direction as Peutinger.  Already Rector of Vienna
University in 1500, he was incessantly employed by
the Emperor on embassies and in affairs of politics.
In the course of five years he was engaged in no
fewer than twenty-four missions to Hungary, and he
took the leading part in the negotiations of 1507 and
1515, which resulted in the double marriage between
Austria and Bohemia-Hungary, and the close union
of Maximilian with Uladislas (1515).  Nothwithstanding
his political activity, he found time for medical
and historical pursuits, lectures and public addresses
on Philosophy and Rhetoric, and elaborate discussions
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P105"></a>105}</span>
with his Humanist friends.  Besides editing several
of the later classical authors,[<a id="chap04fn131text"></a><a href="#chap04fn131">131</a>] he brought out the
<i>Weltchronik</i> of Bishop Otto of Freisingen, and the
same writer's <i>Warlike Deeds of Frederick Barbarossa</i>.
His own productions include an account of the
Congress of Princes at Vienna in 1515, and a sketch of
<i>The Origin, Religion and Tyranny of the Turks</i>, which
naturally roused Imperial interest.  All his most
important works exhibit traces of his connexion with
Maximilian.  His <i>Commentarii de Romanorum
Consulibus</i> are probably the most profound and critical;
but his history <i>De Caesaribus et Imperatoribus
Romanorum</i>,[<a id="chap04fn132text"></a><a href="#chap04fn132">132</a>] which employed him between the years 1512
and 1522, undoubtedly possesses the most practical
interest, since it furnishes us with many valuable
details of Maximilian's life and character.  His other
work, <i>Austria</i>, contains a complete history of the
country up till 1519, as well as a geographical and
topographical description of its several provinces.
Unhappily it was not published till 1553, and by that
time the maps which were to have been included had
disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Under Maximilian's auspices, the medical faculty of
the University was improved to an equal extent with
the others, and an ordinance was issued imposing the
severest penalties, at the hands of the magistrates, on
all foreign physicians whose incompetence was
discovered.  Again, the Emperor's passionate love of
music led to a distinct revival in that noble science.
A famous choirmaster of the day, Heinrich Isaak,
who had spent twelve years in the service of Lorenzo
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P106"></a>106}</span>
the Magnificent, was induced to settle at Maximilian's
Court, where his labours raised the Imperial Chapel
to a high level of musical excellence.  Amongst other
really valuable compositions, his setting to the poem
attributed to Maximilian, "Innsbruck, ich muss dich
lassen," is well known at the present day.  The Court
organist, Paul Hofheimer, was likewise esteemed the
glory of his profession, and was the forerunner of a
school of brilliant organists scattered throughout
Germany.[<a id="chap04fn133text"></a><a href="#chap04fn133">133</a>]
</p>

<p>
Though Maximilian knew well how to employ the
activity of the scholar and the artist, and to stimulate
the most varied aspirations of his time, there is one
necessary limitation to our praise of his attitude.
The buoyancy of his nature was to some extent due
to a trait of vaingloriousness, which gave a rosy
colouring to his own achievements, and prevented
him from seeing himself as others saw him.  Moreover,
this airy self-conceit led him to lay by material,
which should win from posterity a more comprehensive
admission of his greatness than was accorded
either by the bare facts of his political life or by the
estimate of contemporaries; and thus he naturally
emphasized the common idea of that period&mdash;that
history was a relation of the warlike and peaceful
exploits of the monarchs of the world.  And yet he
often rose above his own limitations.  At one time he
eagerly entertained the idea of a great Monumenten-Sammlung,
or collection of authorities for mediaeval
German history; while his encouragement of critical
inquiry atoned for the incompleteness of his own
conceptions.  Still his literary productions are
crowded with passages of fulsome adulation, which,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P107"></a>107}</span>
by reason of over-statement and extravagant diction,
rarely produce the effect intended.
</p>

<p>
Among these works two stand out prominently; yet
even their execution was entrusted to others, partly
no doubt on account of the many political demands
upon Maximilian's time, but also because he did not
himself possess sufficient patience or poetical talent.
<i>Weisskunig</i>[<a id="chap04fn134text"></a><a href="#chap04fn134">134</a>] is a prose romance, much of the material
of which was taken down from Maximilian's
dictation by his secretaries, and re-arranged and
compiled by Marx Treitzsauerwein of Innsbruck.  It is
divided into three parts, of which the latter is too
obvious a mixture of "Wahrheit und Dichtung" to be
of any great value.  The earlier portion describes the
life of the old White King (Frederick III.), his journey
to win his bride, his marriage and his coronation,
while the second deals with the youth and education
of the young White King, Maximilian.  The description
of his endless accomplishments exhibits to the
full the Emperor's love of minute information, as
well as the happy conviction of his own excellence
in almost every art and science.  His quaint
conversation with his father on the art of Government
has already been referred to (p. <a href="#P7">7</a>).  Undoubtedly
the chief interest and value of the book, which was
only given to the world in 1775, lies in its
illustrations, which show Maximilian engaged in the most
varied pursuits.  The charming picture of Mary and
Maximilian teaching each other Flemish and German,
the deathbed of Frederick III. with its simple pathos,
the humorous contrast of the young prince and his
instructors in cannon-founding, his serious
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P108"></a>108}</span>
deportment over his correspondence&mdash;these are but four
scenes chosen somewhat at random from a most
fascinating collection.
</p>

<p>
<i>Teuerdank</i>, the other great prose-epic of Maximilian,
is rather a fairy tale than a history, describing,
under a highly allegorical form, the difficulties which
opposed themselves to the Burgundian marriage.  A
fabulously wealthy King has an only daughter, a
miracle of virtue and beauty, who is to belong to the
most gallant and distinguished of her many suitors.
King Romreich dies before a decision has been come
to, but Princess Ehrenreich sees from his will that
only Ritter Teuerdank is worthy of her hand.  She
summons him and he promptly sets forth to join her,
accompanied by his trusty comrade Erenhold.  But
he is continually detained and led astray by the Evil
One, who urges him to follow his natural instincts,
and throws every kind of adventure in his way.
Moreover, the envious magnates of Ehrenreich's
Court enlist against him three captains, who endeavour
to lure him to destruction.  Fürwittig represents
the vain ambition of youth, to give proof of its strength
and skill and glory, merely for its own gratification;
Unfalo, the fascination for the noble youth, which lies
in travel and adventure by sea and land; while
Neidelhard personifies the deadliest of unseen
enemies, Jealousy, that foe who leads the young
Prince into the most difficult entanglements.  But the
gallant Teuerdank comes scathless through every
ordeal, thanks to his innate virtue and to the powerful
genius of Love.  But even then his trial is not at an
end.  At the request of Ehrenreich, and the exhortation
of a heavenly messenger, he conducts a campaign
against the infidels, who consent to become his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P109"></a>109}</span>
vassals.  At length he is free to return, covered with
glory and honour, to the Court of Ehrenreich, when
the marriage is duly celebrated.  This extravagant
romance, which, with all its sentiment, is inclined to
be wooden and tedious, was actually composed by
Melchior Pfinzing, Provost of St. Sebald's, Nuremberg,
though Maximilian directed its whole tone and
substance.  It also was elaborately illustrated by Beck,
Burgkmair, and others, but its woodcuts are much
inferior in interest and in execution to those of
<i>Weisskunig</i>.  In 1517 the whole work was privately
printed upon parchment, but in 1535 it was
published to the world in an edition which is famous
for its sumptuous style.  The <i>Ehrenpforte</i> and
<i>Triumphzug</i>, the <i>Genealogie</i> and <i>Wappenbuch</i> lend
additional force to the argument that Maximilian's
enthusiasm owed part of its vigour to motives of
self-glorification.  The most important of these works
have already been referred to in connexion with the
Augsburg artists and with Dürer.[<a id="chap04fn135text"></a><a href="#chap04fn135">135</a>]  But some mention
must here be made of the recently discovered <i>Gejaid
Buch</i>, which was written for Maximilian during
1499-1500, by his Master of the Game, Carl von
Spaur, and adorned with rich illuminations, dealing
with the Emperor's sport on the mountains of North
Tyrol.  This book contains such minute information,
that he could at a glance "ascertain the head of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P110"></a>110}</span>
chamois and red deer in any of the 200 and odd
localities described therein," and is full of hints and
suggestions as to the posting of the sportsmen and as
to possible quarters for the night.  Often when there
was no castle in the neighbourhood, the Emperor had
to content himself with a primitive log-hut high up
on the mountain-slopes.  Sometimes, to avoid such
rough lodging for the night, he covered tremendous
distances on horseback, to get back to more frequented
valleys; and it was doubtless on such an occasion as
this that he found a beggar dying by the roadside,
and, dismounting, gave him his own flask to drink
from, wrapped his own mantle round him, and then
rode hotly to the next town to summon a priest.[<a id="chap04fn136text"></a><a href="#chap04fn136">136</a>]
Fatigue was well-nigh unknown to him, and he must
sometimes "have started from his headquarters in
the middle of the night, getting back only after some
thirty-six hours in the saddle....  Only those
acquainted with the very voluminous correspondence of
this keen sportsman can form any idea of the close
attention paid by him to every detail connected with
the chase....  In the thick of a bloody war in the
Netherlands we find him writing letters about a
young ibex buck some peasant women in a remote
Tyrolese valley were keeping for him, or promising in
an autograph letter a silk dress to each of certain
peasants' wives in an isolated glen, as a reward for
preventing their husbands from poaching this rare
game, or giving minute instructions where a particular
couple of hunting hounds were to be kept, and what
was to be done with their puppies."[<a id="chap04fn137text"></a><a href="#chap04fn137">137</a>]  Our
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P111"></a>111}</span>
astonishment is not lessened when we learn that Maximilian
possessed as many as 1,500 hounds.  This brief
digression, to which the Emperor's literary works
have inevitably tempted us, is far from inappropriate
to any description of one whose passion for the chase
led him to sign himself "sportsman and Emperor."
</p>

<p>
Thus, in all their manifold branches, Literature,
Art and Science owe Maximilian a deep debt of
gratitude.  He worthily led the great onward movement
of his day, devoting himself to its cause with
whole-hearted service.  He guided and controlled it up to
the very threshold of that mighty Revolution, in which
"a solitary monk" was destined to shake the world;
and on the threshold it was but fitting that he should
leave its direction to others.  His little foibles and
conceits vanish, in view of the great fact that he had
nobly performed his duty in the march of time; and it
would indeed have been a cruel mockery of fate, had
he been left to see his ideals shattered and falsified,
the world of his conception renovated and transformed,
while he himself, too old in years and too
passionate in conviction to remain leader of the van,
dropped backward amid the indistinguishable throng.
</p>

<p>
Though Maximilian was wholly out of sympathy
with the principles which guided Luther, and would
probably have opposed him had he lived, yet it may
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P112"></a>112}</span>
be said that indirectly the Reformation owes
something to him.  The earlier stages of the German
Renaissance were dominated by a strong theological
bias, and it was only gradually that the prevailing
idea was dispelled, that a student or literary man
must belong to the spiritual order.  The revival of the
study of Greek and Hebrew strengthened the element
of criticism; and with criticism of theology came
criticism of history, and a desire to dispel the mists
which had gathered round the great past of Germany,
and to kindle the growing national spirit by a closer
knowledge of the glorious deeds of men's ancestors.
This patriotic movement, which no one did more to
foster and encourage than Maximilian, soon brought
the passionate upholders of Germany into collision
with foreign sentiment.  The opposition to Italy and
to Rome, which was mainly due to the degradation of
the Papacy and its practice of draining German
resources for purely Italian ends, was regarded with
favour by Maximilian, though his policy was possibly
dictated by secular considerations.  Wimpheling's
attack on Papal abuses in Germany, written at
Maximilian's command, is the most outspoken defiance of
Rome prior to the appearance of Luther.  But while
Maximilian possessed that deep national enthusiasm
which was one of the leading inspirations of Luther's
career, he had none of the Reformer's profound
criticism and self-depreciation, and was too much a
man of action to take any deep interest in questions
of theology.
</p>

<p>
We cannot pass to a final estimate of Maximilian's
character and policy without some mention of the
wonderful monument in the Hofkirche at Innsbruck.
The Church itself was erected in compliance with the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P113"></a>113}</span>
will of Maximilian, but owing to the loss of the
original plans, the whole work was not completed
till the year 1583.  In the centre of the nave stands
a massive marble sarcophagus, which supports the
kneeling figure of Maximilian, surrounded by the four
cardinal virtues.  On the sides of the sarcophagus are
twenty-four exquisite marble reliefs, representing the
principal events of the Emperor's life, all but four of
which were executed by Alexander Colins of Mechlin,
the architect of the famous Otto-Heinrichsbau in
Heidelberg Castle.  Many of the reliefs are especially
interesting for the careful studies of faces; those of
Maximilian's meetings with his daughter Margaret
and with Henry VIII. contain striking portraits of
the Emperor.  But the unique feature of this famous
memorial is the long line of bronze figures which
extend round the nave, the silent witnesses of the
vanished grandeur of the Holy Roman Empire.  All
the great rulers of the House of Hapsburg here watch
over what should have held the mortal remains of
their gallant descendant; while the gentle Mary and
her children take their places in the silent pageant.
But amid all the throng two figures stand out
conspicuously.  Maximilian had wished that the heroes
of his early dreams should share the long vigil over
his grave; and the magic power of Peter Vischer, the
great Nuremberg craftsman, has given the touch of
life and genius to the figures of Theodoric and Arthur.
Fitting indeed it was that the personality of the
champion of the Table Round should be made to rise before
us.  Arthur, the great type of all that was best and
noblest in mediaeval chivalry, and Maximilian, the
last worthy representative of a worn-out order and a
subverted code of honour, are thus indissolubly linked
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P114"></a>114}</span>
together in our imaginations; and as we turn away
from the empty tomb and its spellbound watchers,
we can realize something of the glamour and romance
of the Imperial dreamer's life.

<p>
The wideness of Maximilian's interests, and the
variety of spheres in which those interests led
him to take a part, enhance the difficulty of estimating
or defining his character as a whole, and each
different attitude demands discussion before any general
conclusion can be drawn.  His political career, however,
despite all its intrigues and complications, is
comparatively easy to estimate; for his persistence in
controlling his own policy and his dislike of associates
and confidants throw the entire responsibility of any
given action upon the Emperor's own shoulders.  His
retentive memory and tireless energy aided him in
what would otherwise have been a hopeless effort.
"He seldom or never," writes the Venetian ambassador
in 1496, "discusses with any one what he has in
hand or does, especially in important matters."[<a id="chap05fn138text"></a><a href="#chap05fn138">138</a>]  He
was in the habit of dictating to his secretaries late
into the night, and often drew up important
documents with his own hands; while even during his
meals, and in the midst of his hunting expeditions, he
dictated dispatches or gave instructions to his councillors.
For his credit as a politician this monopolizing
spirit was most unfortunate.  His secrecy kept his
councillors and ambassadors ever in the dark, and
rendered a firm attitude on their part almost impossible.
His over-confidence, both in his own capacity
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P116"></a>116}</span>
and in the honesty of others, received many a rude
shock, and often made him the dupe of his intellectual
inferiors.  Machiavelli tells us the opinion of an
intimate friend of the Emperor, "that anyone could
cheat him without his knowing it."[<a id="chap05fn139text"></a><a href="#chap05fn139">139</a>]  His condemnation
as a bungler by the Florentine statesman has
been used as an argument in Maximilian's favour; but
the only possible inference is that in affairs of state
the Emperor's morals had not suffered so complete an
eclipse as those of his rivals, while his statecraft was
based upon a neglect of sound political principles.
But even more prominent than the self-centred nature
of his policy are two fatal weaknesses in his
character, which account for most of his failures and
disappointments&mdash;his want of perseverance and his
open-handedness.  The whole history of his reign is an
illustration of the inconstancy with which he flitted
from scheme to scheme, never allowing the time
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P117"></a>117}</span>
necessary for a successful issue; and the disastrous
consequences of this habit were only accentuated by
the fact that he remained a law unto himself,
self-deprived of all moderating influences.  It was this
fickle and over-sanguine disposition which caused
Louis XII. to exclaim, "What this King says at night,
he does not hold to the next morning."[<a id="chap05fn140text"></a><a href="#chap05fn140">140</a>]  The criticism
of Ferdinand V. is perhaps even more apposite&mdash;"If
Maximilian thinks of a thing, he also believes that it
is already done."[<a id="chap05fn141text"></a><a href="#chap05fn141">141</a>]  Without duly considering the
means at his disposal, he stormed impetuously
towards an end which was obviously unattainable
under the circumstances, and, to make matters worse,
he had already lost all interest in the project before
there was even a prospect of its being crowned with
success.  In other cases, his inventive intellect showed
him two or three ways towards the same goal, with
the result that he either pursued all at once, or,
confining himself to one only, soon changed his mind and
adopted a course which he regarded as safer.  "And
so," writes Quirini, "he springs from one decision to
another, till time and opportunity are past ... and
thus he wins from all men a light enough reputation."[<a id="chap05fn142text"></a><a href="#chap05fn142">142</a>]
But perhaps the greatest weakness of Maximilian's
administration was faulty finance.  It is true that
the resources at his disposal were wholly inadequate,
whether in the Empire or in his own dominions.  Yet
his own unpractical and visionary nature prevented
him from making the best of such means as he
possessed, and drew him into quite a needless amount of
money difficulties.  He had absolutely no conception
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P118"></a>118}</span>
of the meaning of economy, and, deeming it an
unkingly trait, gave with both hands to his servants and
his friends, and laid no proper check upon his household
expenses.  The fact that he spent but little upon
himself, and that his personal requirements were
frugal in the extreme, while it speaks well for the
generosity of his nature, cannot affect our estimate of
his financial incapacity.  Indeed, such were his
extravagance and his penury, that the Venetian ambassador
was induced to exclaim: "For a ducat he can be won
for anything."[<a id="chap05fn143text"></a><a href="#chap05fn143">143</a>]  And truly, the fact that he actually
served Venice and Milan, and in later years England,
for hire, after the manner of an Italian condottiere,
justifies the severe exaggeration of this remark.  His
liberal patronage of Art and Science, and the
magnificence of the Court entertainments, must have
contributed in some degree to his popularity among
contemporaries; but his ruinous method of raising
supplies in his own dominions really transferred the
burden of his endless undertakings to the shoulders
of the next generation.[<a id="chap05fn144text"></a><a href="#chap05fn144">144</a>]
</p>

<p>
As Emperor, Maximilian has been severely censured
for subordinating the Imperial to the territorial ideal,
and for furthering Hapsburg ambitions at the expense
of Germany as a whole.  But a survey of his youth
and early training at once helps to explain this
policy and proves it to have been inevitable.  Such a
path had been mapped out for him by his father's
motto, A.E.I.O.U., and Frederick's own impotence
to achieve its aspirations only served to impress
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P119"></a>119}</span>
it more firmly upon the youthful Maximilian.  And
indeed there is much truth in his idea, that the building
up of a strong hereditary State was the surest road
towards an imposing position in the Empire.  While
the personal defects of Maximilian, which have already
been discussed, are largely responsible for the
comparative ineffectiveness of his Imperial policy, yet
the chief cause of all was inherent in the
constitution of the Empire.  It can hardly be doubted
but that an Emperor far more powerful than
Maximilian ever was would have failed to
combine the many conflicting elements into a
central Government capable of strong and united
action.  "Constitution, Law, order in the State were
everywhere forcing themselves out of the perverted
forms of the Middle Ages into more perfect models."  But
as yet confusion and impotence held sway, and
the broad principles of reform were obscured from
Maximilian's eyes by a perplexing array of minor
questions.  Feudalism had long been in decay, and
the efforts of rulers in every State were directed
towards extending their authority and bringing the
nobles and the towns into greater dependence upon
the throne.  But the permanent taxation and the
standing army which made the attainment of this
end possible to the French kings, and through which
France became for a number of years the first military
power of Europe, were denied to Maximilian by the
peculiar circumstances of the Empire.  Not even in
his hereditary lands, still less elsewhere, was there
any regular system of "aids" for the sovereign's
support; and Maximilian had to wage his wars, either
with militia, who were ever slow to assemble and
prompt to disband, whose discipline was not beyond
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P120"></a>120}</span>
reproach, and who were not liable to serve outside
their own territory, or with mercenaries, whose
maintenance involved an expense which the absence of
regular taxation made it difficult to meet.  Apart from
the revenues of Crown lands and the deeply mortgaged
mines and tolls, he could raise no contributions
without the Diet's consent; and as a rule each Estate vied
with the others in resolutely setting aside all considerations
of patriotism and maintaining the tightest hold
upon their purse-strings.  They showed no sympathy
with Maximilian's aims and interests; while the
Emperor lacked the power to enforce his wishes upon
them.  Such circumstances would almost justify his
policy of retaliation by obstructing the Diet's efforts
towards reform.  But in any case he can hardly be
blamed for falling back upon a strictly Austrian policy
and using his Imperial office to further Hapsburg
interests.
</p>

<p>
Whenever the Emperor's political action is deserving
of praise, the House of Hapsburg rather than the
Empire will be found to have reaped the benefit.  His
enthusiastic belief in the future greatness of his House
was the guiding star of his whole life, and encouraged
him to consolidate his dominions internally, and
thus, as he hoped, to fit them to become the central
point of a world-wide empire.  Besides the
introduction of Roman law, for which he was mainly
responsible, he thoroughly reorganized the administration
of the Austrian Duchies.  The revenues had
become insufficient for the execution of his princely
duties, especially in time of war; and Maximilian set
himself to introduce into the country the same
methods of Government which he employed in the
Netherlands.  He replaced the old feudal survivals
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P121"></a>121}</span>
in the State by a modern officialdom, which gradually
paralyzed the opposition of the Estates, and from
which certain individuals exercised a permanent
control over the government during his own absence.
Meanwhile it was his Hapsburg and territorial
ambitions which prompted him to reassert the Imperial
authority in Italy, and which were partly responsible
for his eagerness to recover Croatia and Southern
Hungary from the hands of the Turks.  Above all, it
was these ambitions that inspired him in his endless
projects of alliances and marriages&mdash;projects which
secured for his descendants the glorious inheritance
of Spain, the two Sicilies and the New World, and
the Kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary.
</p>

<p>
Passing from his public to his private life, we may
reasonably assert that Maximilian, while far from
spotless, compares favourably with the Princes of
his time.  The excesses of Charles VIII., the luxurious
vice of Louis XII., the barbaric licentiousness of
Francis I., and again the unrestrained passions of
Henry VIII., and Ferdinand V.'s frank disavowal
of morality&mdash;all these traits are happily wanting in
Maximilian's life.  He seems to have loved the
gracious Mary faithfully and tenderly, and it is said
that, to the day of his death, any mention of her name
drew from him a deep sigh of remembrance.  But for
her untimely death he might have resisted the fierce
temptations of his royal position.  He had at least
eight natural children, of whom two only are
known to history&mdash;George, Bishop of Brixen, who
eventually became Prince Bishop of Liège, and a
daughter, who perished with her husband, the Count
of Helfenstein, in the Peasants' Revolt of 1525.  It
cannot be maintained that Maximilian's second
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P122"></a>122}</span>
marriage was a love-match; yet there is reason to believe
that, though he paid little attention to the unfortunate
Bianca Maria, he at least remained faithful to her.
</p>

<p>
Though his table was always magnificently served,
he himself was extremely temperate, both in food and
drink.  Indeed, his strong detestation of drunkenness
forms a pleasant contrast to the opinions and practice
of his courtiers and even of the great princes of the
Empire.  His moderation and healthy diet gave added
strength to a frame which was naturally robust and
untiring.  He could endure with ease the extremes
of heat and cold, prolonged journeys and want of
sleep, and even privations in food and drink.  His
strong constitution was united to a pleasing countenance,
which seldom failed to prepossess in his favour.
A prominent nose and well-defined features, together
with the lightning glances of his eye, imparted to him
a searching look, which seemed to pierce through
men and read their very souls.  Withal, he was fully
endowed with that genial and gracious manner which
veils its condescension under a mingling of good
humour and perfect tactfulness.  In conversation he
exercised a fascination which was not without its
effect even upon his sternest opponents; while the
whole-hearted and friendly spirit with which he threw
himself into the amusements and sports of the
common people won for him an even wider respect and
love than his passion for the chase and his intimate
relations with the Tyrolese mountaineers.  He
frequently took his place in a village dance, or competed
with the peasants in their shooting matches; and he
recommended the chase to his descendants not merely
for those delights which none knew better than
himself, but also because of the opportunities which it
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P123"></a>123}</span>
offered to princes of coming into contact with their
subjects, of learning their wishes and helping them in
their difficulties.  His fresh joyous nature showed
itself in a thousand little touches, but perhaps in none
more vividly than in his ardent love of music and in
the delight which he took in the presence of singing-birds
in the palace of Innsbruck.  Thus whether
fraternizing with the peasants of his beloved Tyrol,
clad in a hunting suit of simple grey, or affably
conversing with the burghers and ladies of Frankfort
or Augsburg, he awoke in all hearts an involuntary
feeling of admiration.
</p>

<p>
Before all, Maximilian was a German of the
Germans.  As he was the last representative of the
dying mediaeval chivalry, and the last monarch of the
ancient German stamp, so also he was the first
German patriot-king of modern times; and herein
lies the secret of the love and admiration which his
contemporaries poured so fully upon him.  The proud
and royal motto to which he gave utterance, "My
honour is German honour, and German honour mine,"
graphically reminds us that he identified himself
with the joys and sorrows, the glories and the failures
of the German race.  It is neglect of this fact, and
want of sympathy with German thought and ideals,
that are responsible for the indiscriminating criticisms
of several modern historians&mdash;criticisms which would
often be bestowed with greater justice upon the
constitution of the Empire than upon the Emperor
himself.  And the motto has been realized in a
further sense.  For the feeling of Germany, turning
from the weaknesses and failures which mar the
fullness of Maximilian's glory, has reciprocated the
loyalty which he expressed towards his people, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P124"></a>124}</span>
has elevated the chivalrous Emperor into one of
the national heroes, worthy to rank with Hermann
and Barbarossa.  For Maximilian, in no uncertain
sense, personified the dreams, the aspirations, the
strugglings of the Fatherland.  The nation, chastened
and revivified by a new birth of patriotism, sought an
object on whom to fix its affections and its hopes.
It turned naturally to the Emperor, the heir of so
many splendid traditions, and it was met on his side
by the ardent devotion of a whole lifetime.  In a
word, he and his people had realized&mdash;incompletely it
may be, yet in a very genuine sense&mdash;the true
relations of a monarch and his subjects, and, linked to one
another by ties of mutual sympathy, handed down the
happy tradition as an example to their remote posterity.
"Kaiser Max" (as his people fondly called him)
was not a great man, in the strictest sense of the
word; yet all lovers of large-hearted and human
characters must ever treasure his memory in their
hearts.

are so equally poised"&mdash;quoted Geiger, p. 346.

APPENDIX

<p class="t3b">
APPENDIX I
</p>

<p>
Though some reference to Maximilian's relations to the
question of Imperial Reform was unavoidable, a detailed
account must be sought for rather in an authoritative history
of Germany than in an essay which centres round an individual.
Hence an appendix seems the most fitting place for dealing with the
subject.
</p>

<p>
When Maximilian was elected King of the Romans (1486), it had
long been evident that, if a new or reformed constitution was to be
secured, the initiative must be taken by the Estates.  During
the years 1486-89 frequent deliberations took place, with a view to
evolving some scheme for strengthening the institutions of the
Empire.  The leaders of the movement sought especially to impart
to the Imperial Diets more regular forms and greater dignity, and
to check the resistance to their decrees which was met with in the
towns.  At the Diet of 1487, the towns, renouncing the policy of
obstruction and equivocation which had characterized them throughout
the century, were fully represented, and took an active part in
the business of the committee which discussed the Landfriede.  In
1489 a new stage of development was reached by the Diet, when the
three Colleges of Electors, Princes and burghers separated for the
first time and conducted their deliberations apart.  Their proposal to
limit the power of the Imperial Tribunal met with determined
opposition from Frederick the Third; and the Estates applied to
Maximilian, and obtained from him a promise of the reform of the
Kammergericht, or Imperial Chamber.  The old Emperor's attitude
necessitated a postponement of the question; but on his death in
1493 it was revived with greater urgency than ever.  The leading
spirit of the whole movement was Berthold of Henneberg, Elector
of Mainz, whose patriotism and calm impartiality won the respect
of all parties.  At the great Diet of Worms, which opened at the end
of March 1495, the Estates united in pressing on Maximilian a
fulfilment of his promises, and persisted in refusing him all support
until he submitted to their demands.  The struggle lasted
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P126"></a>126}</span>
throughout the summer, Maximilian throwing
every obstacle in the way of
reform, but finally, on August 7, he signed his agreement to the
demands of the Diet.  The results of the Diet may be classified
under four heads:
</p>

<p>
1st.  The Landfriede was more closely organized, and was made
perpetual.  No difficulty was experienced over this point, as
Maximilian had taken the lead in enforcing
the Landfriede at an earlier
date.
</p>

<p>
2nd.  The Kammergericht, or Imperial Chamber, was founded, to
act as a court of first instance for all
direct subjects of the Emperor.
Its jurisdiction was, however, limited to cases of prelates, nobles,
knights and towns among each other; in the event of complaints
against any of the princes or electors, an arbitration was first
necessary before the councillors of the accused Prince.  The
Chamber consisted of a judge, nominated by the Emperor, and
sixteen other members, appointed by the Estates, half being of
knightly birth, half learned in the law.
</p>

<p>
Its distinguishing features were:
</p>

<p>
(<i>a</i>) That it was to sit continuously in the Empire, not following
the court, but fixed permanently at Frankfurt-on-Main.
</p>

<p>
(<i>b</i>) That it could receive appeals from the Landgerichte.
</p>

<p>
(<i>c</i>) That its members were to receive their salaries out of the
fees of the court, though they might be supplemented from the
Imperial revenues if these fees proved insufficient.
</p>

<p>
(<i>d</i>) That the judge acquired the power of proclaiming the ban
of the Empire in the sovereign's name.
</p>

<p>
3rd.  A proposal was laid down for yearly meetings of the Estates,
with the object of controlling the Imperial expenditure.  To this
assembly the treasurer was to deliver the money which he received
from the taxes, and it was to hold the exclusive power of deciding
the expenditure; while neither the Emperor nor his son might
declare war without its consent.
</p>

<p>
"The constitution thus proposed was a mixture of Monarchical and
federal Government, but with an obvious preponderance of the
latter element; a political union, preserving the forms of the ancient
hierarchy of the Empire."  But the defective nature of the Diet's
composition, and the virtual impossibility of securing a united
effort for any length of time, prevented the accomplishment of this
scheme.
</p>

<p>
4th.  In return for these concessions on the part of Maximilian, the
Diet instituted "The Common Penny" (Der Gemeine Pfennig).
This was an attempt at systematic taxation, according to which an
impost of half a gulden was levied on every 500 gulden, and among
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P127"></a>127}</span>
the poorer classes every twenty-four people above the age of
fifteen contributed one gulden.
</p>

<p>
The Common Penny was imperfectly organized and soon became
merely nominal, as the needy Maximilian often found to his cost;
and though it was revived under Charles V., it soon disappeared
again after a brief and fitful existence.
</p>

<p>
The only actions of the Diet of Lindau (1496), the next in
succession to that of Worms, were to renew the Common Penny, to
transfer the Imperial Chamber from Frankfurt to Worms, and to
impose a tax upon the Jews of the chief Imperial towns.
</p>

<p>
Though Maximilian had at Worms evaded the demand for a
Reichs-regiment, or Council of Regency, as too serious a limitation
to his prerogative, yet at the Diet of Augsburg (1500) he was obliged
to give way even at this point.  The Diet gave its sanction to a
scheme of military organization, according to which every 400
inhabitants were to provide one foot soldier, the cavalry was to be
raised by the Princes and nobles upon a fixed scale, and a tax
was imposed on those who could not themselves take any active
share.  In return for this concession, Maximilian consented to the
establishment of a Council of Regency, which, had it preserved the
powers which were at first granted to it, would have deprived the
Emperor of whatever power he still possessed.  It was composed of
a President, chosen by the Emperor, one delegate from each of the
Electors, six from the Princes conjointly, two from Austria and the
Netherlands, and two from the Imperial cities.  Its powers were
most comprehensive, and included the administration of justice, the
maintenance of peace, the defence of the Empire from attack, and,
most astounding of all, the control of foreign affairs.  It is
conceivable that Maximilian might have submitted to the Council's
authority, had it displayed becoming
moderation.  But its first act&mdash;the
conclusion of peace with France&mdash;was so directly contrary to the
whole trend of Maximilian's policy, that he was naturally driven
into active opposition to its powers.  "In 1502 he fell back upon
his Imperial right of holding Courts of Justice (Hofgerichte), and
erected a standing court or Aulic Council (Hofrath), entirely under
his own control."  He himself was its president, and its assessors
were arbitrarily appointed.  This action led to a congress of Electors
at Gelnhausen in June 1502, at which they arranged to meet four
times a year to deliberate on public affairs, and actually announced
the first meeting for the following November, without consulting the
Emperor in any way upon the matter.  Maximilian was too weak to
oppose them, and therefore proclaimed the assembly himself.  But
the successful issue of the War of Landshut and the death of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P128"></a>128}</span>
Berthold of Mainz greatly strengthened Maximilian's position in the
Empire, and proportionately weakened the cause of Reform.  Hence
the Council of Regency was allowed to die a natural death.
</p>

<p>
At the Diet of Constance (1507) some progress was again made.
In return for a grant of troops and money, Maximilian re-established
the Imperial Chamber, which had held no sittings for three years,
and a small tax was instituted to pay the salaries of its officials.
The Diets of Worms (1509) and Augsburg (1510) were occupied by
complaints and abuse, which were wholly without effect.  In 1512,
however, the Diet of Koln, to which city it had removed from Trier,
secured the division of the Empire into six Kreise, or Circles, for
administrative and military purposes.  The Circles were to be placed
under Captains, who were all controlled by a Captain-general, and
the organization was to be entrusted to a council of eight, "who
were to act as a Privy Council under the Emperor's control."  But
the jealousy of the Diet refused him the nomination of these
Captains, and of the council,
with the result that the measure fell through
for the time, and did not take effect till 1521, under Charles V.
</p>

<p>
This was the last serious attempt at Reform during the reign
of Maximilian; for the later Diets were mere scenes of confusion and
of mutual recrimination.  The failure of the reforming movement
only served to emphasize the fact that the constitution of the
Empire had become an unworkable machine, and that the Empire
itself could only be saved from weakness and disorganization by
the rise of a strong central monarchy.  But this was not to be.
Such a contingency, which Maximilian's vast dreams of Austrian
world-power had seemed to foreshadow, was rendered impossible
by the great spiritual revolution, which filled all minds throughout
the reign of Charles V.  Several centuries were required to permit
the growth of a strong German state out of the chaos of the
mediaeval Empire; and it was reserved for the nineteenth century
to see a native dynasty restore to Germany the long-lost blessings
of consolidation and unity.

*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MAXIMILIAN I ***

***** This file should be named 51496-h.htm or 51496-h.zip *****
This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:
        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/4/9/51496/

Produced by Al Haines
Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

    Dr. Gregory B. Newby
    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
